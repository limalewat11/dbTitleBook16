What did early Christians believe about the divinity of Christ? What were the beliefs of those who sat at the feet of Jesus' disciples? Now, for the first time, a unique dictionary has been developed to allow easy access to the ancient material and furnish ready answers to these questions and others like them. David W. Bercot has painstakingly combed the writings of these early church leaders and categorized the heart of their thinking into more than 700 theological, moral, and historical topics to create A Dictionary of Early Christian Beliefs. Wonderfully suited for devotional or thematic study as well as sermon illustration, this resource offers a window into the world of the early church and affords a special opportunity to examine topically the thoughts of students of the original apostles, as well as other great lights in the life of the early church. <br>- Collects relevant comments on key Christian concepts from prominent figures such as Origen, Clement of Alexandria, Clement of Rome, and Hippolytus.<br>- Includes key biblical verses associated with a given topic.<br>- Offers brief definitions of unfamiliar terms or concepts, allowing easy access to the ancient material.<br>- Provides a "Who's Who" of ante-Nicene Christianity to put in context the ancient Christian writers.<br>- Discusses more than 700 key theological, moral, and historical topics.<br>- Gives strategic cross-reverences to related topics.<br>- Functions as a topical index to the writings of the Ante-Nicene Fathers.<br></p><p>David W. Bercot, an Anglican priest and an attorney, graduated from Stephen F. Austin State University and Baylor University School of Law. He is the author of Will the Real Heretics Please Stand Up and is a member of the North American Patristics Society.<p>"At times sermons and books refer to the beliefs and writings of early Christian leaders, and this dictionary is a compilation of those, arranged according to more than seven hundred topics. What did Clement of Alexandria say about abortion? What did Irenaeus note concerning the priesthood of the believer? How did Justin Martyr view the matter of divorce? Needless to say, the book is very interesting.</p><p>"The book begins with a 'Who's Who' listing of the ante-Nicene Fathers whose comments are included throughout this reference tool. The section lists not only their names but also what they are remembered for, when they lived, and how to pronounce their names. 'How to Use This Dictionary' at the beginning is useful too. . . . it is good to have a handy resource on what [the church fathers] believed and said." --"Baptist Bulletin"<br><br>""A Dictionary of Early Christian Beliefs " is the best overall introduction to the ante-Nicene fathers in print, and is perfect for group study! The ultimate Sunday school reference work.<br>--www.AmericanVision.org</p></p><h2>The Canterbury Tales (No Fear) (Volume 1)</h2><p><p>Why be frightened of the most wonderful collection of tales ever written?&nbsp; <i>No Fear: The Canterbury Tales</i> makes it simple for students to love Chaucer&#x2019;s masterpiece in all its humor, bawdiness, and poignancy.&nbsp; It features the original text on the left-hand page, side-by-side with an easy-to-understand translation on the right; in addition, there is a complete list of characters with descriptions and plenty of helpful commentary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p></p><h2>Martin Chuzzlewit (Wordsworth Classics) (Wordsworth Collection)</h2><p>With an Introduction and Notes by Dr John Bowen, Department of English, University of Keele Martin Chuzzlewit is Charles Dickens&#39; comic masterpiece about which his biographer, Forster, noted that it marked a crucial phase in the author&#39;s development as he began to delve deeper into the &#39;springs of character&#39;. Old Martin Chuzzlewit, tormented by the greed and selfishness of his family, effectively drives his grandson, young Martin, to undertake a voyage to America. It is a voyage which will have crucial consequences not only for young Martin, but also for his grandfather and his grandfather&#39;s servant, Mary Graham with whom young Martin is in love. The commercial swindle of the Anglo-Bengalee company and the fraudulent Eden Land Corporation have a topicality in our own time. This strong sub-plot shows evidence of Dickens&#39; mastery of crime where characters such as the criminal Jonas Chuzzlewit, the old nurse Mrs Gamp, and the arch-hypocrite Seth Pecksniff are the equal to any in his other great novels. Generations of readers have also delighted in Dickens&#39; wonderful description of the London boarding-house - &#39;Todgers&#39;.</p><p>The classic, definitive, world-famous Nonesuch Press edition of 1937, finally available again and bound in leather and linen. The text in these stunning volumes is taken from the 1867 Chapman and Hall edition, which became known as the Charles Dickens edition and was the last edition to be corrected by the author himself. The Nonesuch edition contains full-color illustrations selected by Dickens himself, by artists including Hablot Knight Browne ("Phiz"), George Cruikshank, John Leech, Robert Seymour, and George Cattermole.<br><br> <i>The Nonesuch Dickens</i> reproduces the original elegance of these beautiful editions.

Each volume is wrapped in a protective, clear acetate jacket.<br><br> The books are available as individual volumes, or as sets. The six-volume set contains <i>Oliver Twist, Bleak House, Christmas Books, Nicholas Nickleby, David Copperfield,</i> and <i>Great Expectations</i> together with <i>Hard Times</i>. The three-volume set contains <i>A Tale of Two Cities, Little Dorrit,</i> and <i>The Life and Adventures of Martin Chuzzlewit</i>.At The Center of Martin Chuzzlewit -- the novel Angus Wilson called "one of the most sheerly exciting of all Dickens stories" -- is Martin himself, very old, very rich, very much on his guard. What he suspects (with good reason) is that every one of Iris close and distant relations. now converging in droves on the country inn where they believe he is dying, will stop at nothing to become the inheritor of Iris great fortune. <br>Having unjustly disinherited Iris grandson, young Martin, the old fellow now trusts no one but Mary Graham, the pretty girl hired as Iris companion. Though she has been made to understand she will not inherit a penny, she remains old Chuzzlewit's only ally. As the viperish relations and hangers-on close in on him, we meet some of Dickens's most marvelous characters -- among them Mr. Pecksniff (whose name has entered the language as a synonym for ultimate hypocrisy and self-importance); the fabulously evil Jonas Chuzzlewit; the strutting reptile Tigg Montague; and the ridiculous, terrible, comical Sairey Gamp. <br>Reluctantly heading for America in search of opportunity, the penniless young Martin goes west, rides a riverboat, and is overtaken by bad company and mortal danger -- while the battle for his grandfather's gold reveals new depths of family treachery, cunning, and ruthlessness. And in scene after wonderful scene of conflict and suspense, of high excitement and fierce and hilarious satire, Dickens's huge saga of greed versus decency comes to its magnificent climax.</p><h2>Microeconomics (Mcgraw-hill Series: Economics)</h2><p><p>McConnell/Brue/Flynn has long set the standard for providing high-quality content to instructors and students alike.

According to Llinas, the "mindness state" evolved to allow predictive interactions between mobile creatures and their environment. He illustrates the early evolution of mind through a primitive animal called the "sea squirt." The mobile larval form has a brainlike ganglion that receives sensory information about the surrounding environment. As an adult, the sea squirt attaches itself to a stationary object and then digests most of its own brain. This suggests that the nervous system evolved to allow active movement in animals. To move through the environment safely, a creature must anticipate the outcome of each movement on the basis of incoming sensory data. Thus the capacity to predict is most likely the ultimate brain function. One could even say that Self is the centralization of prediction.</p><p>At the heart of Llinas's theory is the concept of oscillation. Many neurons possess electrical activity, manifested as oscillating variations in the minute voltages across the cell membrane. On the crests of these oscillations occur larger electrical events that are the basis for neuron-to-neuron communication. Like cicadas chirping in unison, a group of neurons oscillating in phase can resonate with a distant group of neurons. This simultaneity of neuronal activity is the neurobiological root of cognition. Although the internal state that we call the mind is guided by the senses, it is also generated by the oscillations within the brain. Thus, in a certain sense, one could say that reality is not all "out there," but is a kind of virtual reality.</p></p><p>What is it about neuroscience that graces its practitioners with humility? Rodolfo Llinas of the NYU School of Medicine continues this tradition of quietly tackling the deepest issues in <i>I of the Vortex</i>. This exposition on the evolution and development of consciousness is accessible and intriguing enough to interest readers more philosophically than scientifically oriented. Grounded in research, the book posits our awareness as an artifact of the cortico-thalamic binding of perceptions and movements in synchrony; Llinas uses this theory as a launching pad for more far-reaching considerations of selfhood all the more relevant for their correlation with the facts.<p> Charmingly illustrated with artistic and scientific images cleverly supporting the arguments, the book is a quick if challenging read, and it explains all the scientific basics for those approaching from the humanities. Synthesizing evolution, philosophy, and neuroscience is becoming an increasingly popular endeavor for introspective eggheads, and we should be grateful: the question of consciousness affects us all and touches on every other field, from theology to particle physics. <i>I of the Vortex</i> is a welcome contribution to the theory of mind and essential reading for the introspective. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>Rodolfo R.

The next best thing is doing hands-on explorations at school or at home with this guide." &#x2014;&nbsp;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><br><b><i><br></i></b>Mr. Whiskers, the teacher, has that wild look in his eyes again. That&#x2019;s the look that means, Get ready for hands-on science! This time the subject matter is . . . matter. Using seven science stations, Mr. Whiskers encourages his kids to use all their senses to make observations and draw conclusions. Everyone&#x2019;s a scientist in Mr. Whiskers&#x2019; class, where hands-on mini-experiments lead to Big Ideas &#x2014; and promote an ongoing passion for independent, open-ended discovery. Back matter includes supplemental activities.</p><p>Michael Elsohn Ross is the author of more than forty books for children, most about science or world cultures. He lives right next to California's Yosemite National Park, where, for close to thirty years, he has been working as a naturalist, taking visitors on hikes and walks to learn all about the park. His ideas, he says, "come from my work as a naturalist and my adventures with school kids."<br><br>Paul Meisel is well known for his illustrations in more than thirty<br>children's books, including the Cool Crazy Crickets books by David Elliott, ALMOST LATE TO SCHOOL and other picture books by Carol Diggory Shields, and books in the Let's-Read-and-Find-Out science series.Kindergarten-Grade 3&#x2013;Mr. Whiskers allows his eight students to spend the day exploring seven science centers around the classroom and on the playground. As the students experiment, they uncover "big ideas" about matter. For example, using water droppers allows them to figure out that matter takes up space, while playing with "gloop" points out that matter can be explored by using the senses. As each concept is revealed, it is displayed in the ink-and-watercolor illustrations on a bulletin board, banner, or clipboard. Although this book is not as fantastic as Joanna Cole's "Magic School Bus" stories (Scholastic), it takes a similar approach by encouraging students to learn through interacting with one another as well as with adults. Readers can follow the characters' thought processes through the narration and in dialogue bubbles. Mr. Whiskers provides a note to adults at the beginning about how students learn through exploration and again at the end by supplying information on how to create learning kits (including addresses for purchasing supplies). Although adults might be able to glean some ideas from this book, it's really more for entertainment.<i>&#x2013;Sandra Welzenbach, Villarreal Elementary School, San Antonio, TX</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A fully updated editorial introduction and bibliography has been included for each extract in this new edition.</p><p><p>Described as one of the most influential figures in human history, Karl Marx was a German philosopher and economist who wrote extensively on the benefits of socialism and the flaws of free-market capitalism. His most notable works, Das Kapital and The Communist Manifesto (the latter of which was co-authored by his collaborator Friedrich Engels), have since become two of history s most important political and economic works. Marxism the term that has come to define the philosophical school of thought encompassing Marx s ideas about society, politics and economics was the foundation for the socialist movements of the twentieth century, including Leninism, Stalinism, Trotskyism, and Maoism. Despite the negative reputation associated with some of these movements and with Communism in general, Marx s view of a classless socialist society was a utopian one which did not include the possibility of dictatorship. Greatly influenced by the philosopher G. W. F. Hegel, Marx wrote in radical newspapers from his young adulthood, and can also be credited with founding the philosophy of dialectical materialism. Marx died in London in 1883 at the age of 64.</p></p><h2>The Algebra of Revolution: The Dialectic and the Classical Marxist Tradition (Revolutionary Studies (Paperback))</h2><p>This book provides the only single volume study of major Marxist thinkers&#39; views on the crucial question of the dialectic, connecting them with pressing contemporary, political and theoretical questions.</p><p>John Rees is the editor of International Socialism, Britain&#39;s largest journal of socialist theory.""The Algebra of Revolution offers a fresh and superbly clarifying account of the major developments in classical Marxism.

The curious joined the procession, asked:&nbsp; "Who's being buried?"&nbsp; "Zhivago," came the answer.&nbsp; "So that's it.&nbsp; Now I see."&nbsp; "Not him.&nbsp; Her."&nbsp; "It's all the same.&nbsp; God rest her soul.&nbsp; A rich funeral."<br>&nbsp;<br>The last minutes flashed by, numbered, irrevocable.&nbsp; "The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof; the world, and those that dwell therein."&nbsp; The priest, tracing a cross, threw a handful of earth onto Marya Nikolaevna.&nbsp; They sang "With the souls of the righteous."&nbsp; A terrible bustle began.&nbsp; The coffin was closed, nailed shut, lowered in.&nbsp; A rain of clods drummed down as four shovels hastily filled the grave.&nbsp; Over it a small mound rose.&nbsp; A ten-year-old boy climbed onto it.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>Only in the state of torpor and insensibility that usually comes at the end of a big funeral could it have seemed that the boy wanted to speak over his mother's grave.<br>&nbsp;<br>He raised his head and looked around from that height at the autumn wastes and the domes of the monastery with an absent gaze.&nbsp; His snub-nosed face became distorted.&nbsp; His neck stretched out.&nbsp; If a wolf cub had raised his head with such a movement, it would have been clear that he was about to howl.&nbsp; Covering his face with his hands, the boy burst into sobs.&nbsp; A cloud flying towards him began to lash his hands and face with the wet whips of a cold downpour.&nbsp; A man in black, with narrow, tight-fitting, gathered sleeves, approached the grave.&nbsp; This was the deceased woman's brother and the weeping boy's uncle, Nikolai Nikolaevich Vedenyapin, a priest defrocked at his own request.&nbsp; He went up to the boy and led him out of the cemetery.<br>&nbsp;<br>2<br>&nbsp;<br>They spent the night in one of the monastery guest rooms, allotted to the uncle as an old acquaintance.&nbsp; It was the eve of the Protection.<b>2</b>&nbsp; The next day he and his uncle were to go far to the south, to one of the provincial capitals on the Volga, where Father Nikolai worked for a publisher who brought out a local progressive newspaper.&nbsp; The train tickets had been bought, the luggage was tied up and standing in the cell.&nbsp; From the nearby station the wind carried the plaintive whistling of engines maneuvering in the distance.<br>&nbsp;<br>Towards evening it turned very cold.&nbsp; The two ground-floor windows gave onto the corner of an unsightly kitchen garden surrounded by yellow acacia bushes, onto the frozen puddles of the road going past, and onto the end of the cemetery where Marya Nikolaevna had been buried that afternoon.&nbsp; The kitchen garden was empty, except for a few moir� patches of cabbage, blue from the cold.&nbsp; When the wind gusted, the leafless acacia bushes thrashed about as if possessed and flattened themselves to the road.<br>&nbsp;<br>During the night Yura was awakened by a tapping at the window.&nbsp; The dark cell was supernaturally lit up by a fluttering white light.&nbsp; In just his nightshirt, Yura ran to the window and pressed his face to the cold glass.<br>&nbsp;<br>Beyond the window there was no road, no cemetery, no kitchen garden.&nbsp; A blizzard was raging outside, the air was smoky with snow.&nbsp; One might have thought the storm noticed Yura and, knowing how frightening it was, reveled in the impression it made on him.&nbsp; It whistled and howled and tried in every way possible to attract Yura's attention.&nbsp; From the sky endless skeins of white cloth, turn after turn, fell on the earth, covering it in a winding sheet.&nbsp;&nbsp; The blizzard was alone in the world, nothing rivalled it.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>Yura's first impulse, when he got down from the windowsill, was to get dressed and run outside to start doing something.&nbsp; He was afraid now that the monastery cabbage would be buried and never dug out, now that mama would be snowed under and would be helpless to resist going still deeper and further away from him into the ground.<br>&nbsp;<br>Again it ended in tears.&nbsp; His uncle woke up, spoke to him of Christ and comforted him, then yawned, went to the window, and fell to thinking.&nbsp; They began to dress.&nbsp; It was getting light.<br>&nbsp;<br>3<br>&nbsp;<br>While his mother was alive, Yura did not know that his father had abandoned them long ago, had gone around various towns in Siberia and abroad, carousing and debauching, and that he had long ago squandered and thrown to the winds the millions of their fortune.&nbsp; Yura was always told that he was in Petersburg or at some fair, most often the one in Irbit.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>But then his mother, who had always been sickly, turned out to have consumption.&nbsp; She began going for treatment to the south of France or to northern Italy, where Yura twice accompanied her.&nbsp; Thus, in disorder and amidst perpetual riddles, Yura spent his childhood, often in the hands of strangers, who changed all the time.&nbsp; He became used to these changes, and in such eternally incoherent circumstances his father's absence did not surprise him.<br>&nbsp;<br>As a little boy, he had still caught that time when the name he bore was applied to a host of different things.&nbsp; There was the Zhivago factory, the Zhivago bank, the Zhivago buildings, a way of tying and pinning a necktie with a Zhivago tie-pin, and even some sweet, round-shaped cake, a sort of baba au rhum, called a Zhivago, and at one time in Moscow you could shout to a cabby:&nbsp; "To Zhivago!" just like "To the devil's backyard!" and he would carry you off in his sleigh to a fairy-tale kingdom.&nbsp; A quiet park surrounded you.&nbsp; Crows landed on the hanging fir branches, shaking down hoarfrost.&nbsp; Their cawing carried, loud as the crack of a tree limb.&nbsp; From the new buildings beyond the clearing, pure-bred dogs came running across the road.&nbsp; Lights were lit there.&nbsp; Evening was falling.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>Suddenly it all flew to pieces.&nbsp; They were poor.<br>&nbsp;<br>4<br>&nbsp;<br>In the summer of 1903, Yura and his uncle were riding in a tarantass and pair over the fields to Duplyanka, the estate of Kologrivov, the silk manufacturer and great patron of the arts, to see Ivan Ivanovich Voskoboinikov, a pedagogue and popularizer of useful knowledge.<br>&nbsp;<br>It was the feast of the Kazan Mother of God,<b>3</b>&nbsp;the thick of the wheat harvest.&nbsp; Either because it was lunchtime or on account of the feast day, there was not a soul in the fields.&nbsp; The sun scorched the partly reaped strips like the half-shaven napes of prisoners.&nbsp; Birds circled over the fields.&nbsp; Its ears drooping, the wheat drew itself up straight in the total stillness or stood in shocks far off the road, where, if you stared long enough, it acquired the look of moving figures, as if land surveyors were walking along the edge of the horizon and taking notes.<br>&nbsp;<br>"And these," Nikolai Nikolaevich asked Pavel, a handyman and watchman at the publishing house, who was sitting sideways on the box, stooping and crossing his legs, as a sign that he was not a regular coachman and driving was not his calling, "are these the landowner's or the peasants'?"&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>"Them's the master's," Pavel replied, lighting up, "and them there," having lighted up and inhaled, he jabbed with the butt of the whip handle towards the other side and said after a long pause, "them there's ours.&nbsp; Gone to sleep, eh?" he scolded the horses every so often, glancing at their tails and rumps out of the corner of his eye, like an engineer watching a pressure gauge.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>But the horses pulled like all horses in the world; that is, the shaft horse ran with the innate directness of an artless nature, while the outrunner seemed to the uncomprehending to be an arrant idler, who only knew how to arch its neck like a swan and do a squatting dance to the jingling of the harness bells, which its own leaps set going.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>Nikolai Nikolaevich was bringing Voskoboinikov the proofs of his little book on the land question, which, in view of increased pressure from the censorship, the publisher had asked him to revise. <br>&nbsp;<br>"Folk are acting up in the district," said Nikolai Nikolaevich.&nbsp; "In the Pankovo area they cut a merchant's throat and a zemstvo man<b>4</b>&nbsp;had his stud burned down.&nbsp; What do you think of that?&nbsp; What are they saying in your village?"<br>&nbsp;<br>But it turned out that Pavel took an even darker view of things than the censor who was restraining Voskoboinikov's agrarian passions.<br>&nbsp;<br>"What're they saying?&nbsp; Folk got free and easy.&nbsp; Spoiled, they say.&nbsp; Can you do that with our kind?&nbsp; Give our muzhiks the head, they'll crush each other, it's God's truth.&nbsp; Gone to sleep, eh?"<br>&nbsp;<br>This was the uncle and nephew's second trip to Duplyanka. Yura thought he remembered the way, and each time the fields spread out wide, with woods embracing them in front and behind in a narrow border, it seemed to Yura that he recognized the place where the road should turn right, and at the turn there would appear and after a moment vanish the seven-mile panorama of Kologrivovo, with the river glistening in the distance and the railroad running beyond it.&nbsp; But he kept being mistaken.&nbsp; Fields were succeeded by fields.&nbsp; Again and again they were embraced by woods.&nbsp; The succession of these open spaces was tuned to a vast scale.&nbsp; You wanted to dream and think about the future.<br>&nbsp;<br>Not one of the books that were later to make Nikolai Nikolaevich famous had yet been written.&nbsp; But his thoughts were already defined.&nbsp; He did not know how near his hour was.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>Soon he was to appear among the representatives of the literature of that time, university professors and philosophers of the revolution &#x2013; this man who had thought over all their themes and who, apart from terminology, had nothing in common with them.&nbsp; The whole crowd of them held to some sort of dogma and contented themselves with words and appearances, but Father Nikolai was a priest who had gone through Tolstoyism<b> </b>and revolution5 and kept going further all the time.&nbsp; He thirsted for a wingedly material thought, which would trace a distinct, unhypocritical path in its movement and would change something in the world for the better, and which would be noticeable even to a child or an ignoramus, like a flash of lightning or a roll of thunder.&nbsp; He thirsted for the new.<br>&nbsp;<br>Yura felt good with his uncle.&nbsp; He resembled his mother.&nbsp; He was a free spirit, as she had been, with no prejudice against anything inhabitual.&nbsp; Like her, he had an aristocratic feeling of equality with all that lived.&nbsp; He understood everything at first glance, just as she had, and was able to express his thoughts in the form in which they came to him at the first moment, while they were alive and had not lost their meaning.<br>&nbsp;<br>Yura was glad that his uncle was taking him to Duplyanka.&nbsp; It was very beautiful there, and the picturesqueness of the place also reminded him of his mother, who had loved nature and had often taken him on walks with her.&nbsp; Besides that, Yura was pleased that he would again meet Nika Dudorov, a high-school boy who lived at Voskoboinikov's and probably despised him for being two years younger, and who, when greeting him, pulled his hand down hard and bowed his head so low that the hair fell over his forehead, covering half his face.</p></p><h2>Vera (Vintage Classics)</h2><p>Lucy Entwhistle and Everard Wemyss are both reeling from recent unhappiness when they meet and swiftly fall in love.

But for the backyard builder with limited experience and a tight budget, the choice is not so complicated. Traditional plank-on-frame and cold-molded construction require complicated lofting and building molds--to say nothing of expensive tooling and lots of time. Stitch-and-glue construction, on the other hand, can produce the same results with a substantial savings in time and money. The process is quicker, easier, uses fewer parts, and produces a boat that is much easier to maintain--without the building molds and with only the simplest lofting. For tools, you need little more than a circular saw, a sander/polisher/grinder, a block plane, a framing square, a level, and a tape measure. </p><p>Sam Devlin has elevated stitch-and-glue boatbuilding to an artform, and his graceful designs have attracted the attention of backyard builders across the country. Here is all you need to know to build the boat of your dreams, whether it's a 7-foot dinghy or a 40-foot power cruiser. <i>Devlin's Boatbuilding: How to Build Any Boat the Stitch-and-Glue Way</i> shares the wisdom of his 16 years of experience designing, building, and helping others build his fleet of small sail- and powerboats. </p><p>It's all here, from choosing a design and setting up shop to painting the finished hull and launching. There is also a gallery of Devlin's designs and a detailed appendix listing sources for tools and other materials.</p></p><p><b>Sam Devlin</b> has been in love with boats since childhood--a fact perhaps influenced by his first bedroom, a ship replica complete with curved walls and a seaberth. The boatbuilding operation he started with his wife on a shoestring in 1977 has flourished, and Devlin Designing Boat Builders each year rolls out between 20 and 40 stitch-and-glue boats of various sizes from its shop on the shores of Puget Sound.</p><h2>Le Ton Beau De Marot: In Praise of The Music of Language</h2><p>Lost in an art the art of translation. Thus, in an elegant anagram (translation = lost in an art), Pulitzer Prize-winning author and pioneering cognitive scientist Douglas Hofstadter hints at what led him to pen a deep personal homage to the witty sixteenth-century French poet Cl�ment Marot.&#x201d; <i>Le ton beau de Marot</i> &#x201d; literally means &#x201d;The sweet tone of Marot&#x201d;, but to a French ear it suggests &#x201d;Le tombeau de Marot&#x201d; that is, &#x201d;The tomb of Marot&#x201d;. That double entendre foreshadows the linguistic exuberance of this book, which was sparked a decade ago when Hofstadter, under the spell of an exquisite French miniature by Marot, got hooked on the challenge of recreating both its sweet message and its tight rhymes in English jumping through two tough hoops at once.In the next few years, he not only did many of his own translations of Marot's poem, but also enlisted friends, students, colleagues, family, noted poets, and translators even three state-of-the-art translation programs! to try their hand at this subtle challenge.The rich harvest is represented here by 88 wildly diverse variations on Marot's little theme. Yet this barely scratches the surface of <i>Le Ton beau de Marot</i> , for small groups of these poems alternate with chapters that run all over the map of language and thought.Not merely a set of translations of one poem, <i>Le Ton beau de Marot </i> is an autobiographical essay, a love letter to the French language, a series of musings on life, loss, and death, a sweet bouquet of stirring poetry but most of all, it celebrates the limitless creativity fired by a passion for the music of words.Dozens of literary themes and creations are woven into the picture, including Pushkin's <i> Eugene Onegin</i> , Dante's <i>Inferno,</i> Salinger's <i>Catcher in the Rye</i> , Villon's <i> Ballades, </i> Nabokov's essays, Georges Perec's <i>La Disparition,</i> Vikram Seth's <i>Golden Gate, </i> Horace's odes, and more.Rife with stunning form-content interplay, crammed with creative linguistic experiments yet always crystal-clear, this book is meant not only for lovers of literature, but also for people who wish to be brought into contact with current ideas about how creativity works, and who wish to see how today's computational models of language and thought stack up next to the human mind. <i>Le Ton beau de Marot </i> is a sparkling, personal, and poetic exploration aimed at both the literary and the scientific world, and is sure to provoke great excitement and heated controversy among poets and translators, critics and writers, and those involved in the study of creativity and its elusive wellsprings.</p><p>In the fall of 1537, a child was confined to bed for some time. The French poet Cl�ment Marot wrote her a get-well poem, 28 lines long, each line a scant three syllables. In the mid-1980s, the outrageously gifted Douglas R. Hofstadter--<i>il miglior fabbro</i> of <i>Godel, Escher, Bach</i>--first attempted to translate this "sweet, old, small elegant French poem into English." He was later to challenge friends, relations, and colleagues to do the same. The results were exceptional, and are now contained in <i>Le Ton Beau De Marot</i>, a sunny exploration of scholarly and linguistic play and love's infinity. Less sunny, however, is the tragedy that hangs over Hofstadter's book, the sudden death of his wife, Carol, from a brain tumor. (Her translation is among the book's finest.)<p> Marot's poem, in Hofstadter's initial translation (he is to compose many more), begins: "My sweet, / I bid you / A good day; / The stay / Is prison. / Health / Recover, / Then open / Your door ... "--a slim frame on which to hang 600 or so pages of text. But the book is far more than a compendium of translators' triumphs (with the occasional misstep). Most of the renderings are original and lively, some lovely, though Hofstadter often feels compelled to improve them. He lightly laments that Bill Cavnar's rendering, "though superb along so many dimensions at once, still seems to lack a bit of that intangible verbal sparkle that I associate with the deepest Maroticity."</p><p> Hofstadter's talents lie in linking his intoxication, erudition, and vision with humor, autobiography, and free association. His book takes on "rigidists," asks questions like, "Is plagiarism potentially creative?" and strives to define linguistic soul. Along the way, it accords the same level of respect to the seemingly trivial: sex jokes, Texas jokes, <i>The Seven Year Itch</i>, and the puzzle of how someone you love can hate a food that you adore. Throughout there is pun, ingenuity, and above all, love for language--which can compress distance and, through constraint, lead to freedom.</p><b>Douglas R.

Combining the two aspects of his life seemed a natural choice and he enjoys researching, writing about, and taking photographs of rocks and minerals. Working with his father, Bob Lynch, a respected veteran of Lake Superior&#x2019;s agate-collecting community, Dan spearheads their series of rock and mineral field guides&#x2015;definitive guidebooks that help amateurs &#x201c;decode&#x201d; the complexities of geology and mineralogy. He also takes special care to ensure that his photographs compliment the text and always represent each rock or mineral exactly as it appears in person. He currently works as a writer and photographer in Madison, Wisconsin, with his beautiful wife, Julie. Bob Lynch is a lapidary and jeweler living and working in Two Harbors, Minnesota. He has been cutting and polishing rocks and minerals since 1973, when he desired more variation in gemstones for his work with jewelry. When he moved from Douglas, Arizona, to Two Harbors in 1982, his eyes were opened to Lake Superior&#x2019;s entirely new world of minerals. In 1992, Bob and his wife Nancy, whom he taught the art of jewelry making, acquired Agate City Rock Shop, a family business founded by Nancy&#x2019;s grandfather, Art Rafn, in 1962. Since the shop&#x2019;s revitalization, Bob has made a name for himself as a highly acclaimed agate polisher and as an expert resource for curious collectors seeking advice. Now, the two jewelers keep Agate City Rocks and Gifts open year-round and are the leading source for Lake Superior agates, with more on display and for sale than any other shop in the country.<p><b>Quartz</b> </p><p><b>Hardness:</b> 7 <b>Streak:</b> White </p><p><b>Environment:</b> All environments </p><p><b>What to look for:</b> Light-colored, translucent, glassy and very hard six-sided crystals, masses or veins in rock, or abundant white water-worn pebbles on beaches </p><p><b>Size:</b> Quartz crystals can range from pinhead-sized points to crystals several inches long; masses can be any size </p><p><b>Color:</b> Colorless to white when pure; frequently stained yellow to brown or red, and rarely purple </p><p><b>Occurrence:</b> Very common </p><p><b>Notes:</b> Twelve percent of the material in the earth&#x2019;s crust consists of quartz, and it is the most abundant mineral on earth. It&#x2019;s therefore essential for rock hounds to be familiar with it. Quartz consists of silica, the silicon- and oxygen-bearing compound that contributes to the formation of hundreds of minerals. It&#x2019;s found most often as uninteresting white masses in rocks such as granite, or as microscopic grains in chert (page 95). But collectors want crystals, and luckily, crystals are quite common too. They occur most often in rock cavities and take the form of elongated hexagonal (six-sided) prisms that terminate (end) in a point. Crystals are often intergrown with each other, sometimes as a thin crust of countless tiny crystals called druse. Until you recognize quartz&#x2019;s appearance, you can distinguish it from similar-looking minerals, such as calcite (page 85), by a hardness test. Quartz is harder than anything you&#x2019;ll easily find and won&#x2019;t be scratched by a knife. Its conchoidal fracture (when struck, circular cracks appear) is also distinct. </p><p><b>Where to Look:</b> Some of the finest crystals come from locations in King County, Washington. Lesser, water-worn specimens can be found all along the Pacific Coast in both states.</p></p><h2>VISION: THE COMPLETE COLLECTION</h2><p>A super hero story like no other.

He earned a Ph.D. in African American Studies from Temple University then returned to Clark Atlanta as a professor with hopes of inspiring young black minds to believe in themselves.</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>Gus stood beside the living room window, waiting for the annual spring rains. They should have come by now, he noted, glancing at the battered Motley Funeral Home calendar hanging from a nail on the wall. It was May 17, 1940, and Gus&#x2019;s wilted crops made him wonder if, somehow, he had angered Mother Nature. Usually the rains came between March and April, freeing him to hunt or fish the latter part of spring while cabbage, collard, and tomato sprouts strengthened in the moistened earth. That year, the stubborn rains prolonged the daily sojourn Gus and the boys took to the river and back&#x2014;locals called it the Jordan&#x2014;carrying five-gallon buckets of water for both their own and the sprouts&#x2019; survival.</p><p>Gus loved the rains. As a child, he lay in bed listening to the thunderous polyrhythms they drummed into the rusted tin rooftop. Something about the melody soothed his somber soul and allowed him to cry without fear of his father&#x2019;s reprisal. After all, he was a boy, Chester Peace Sr. loved to remind him&#x2014;as though his genitalia didn&#x2019;t&#x2014;and tears didn&#x2019;t speak well for one who would, one day, become a man. The indelible imprint of Chester Sr.&#x2019;s inordinately large hand on Gus&#x2019;s tender face whenever he wept never bothered the boy who, in his heart, wanted nothing more desperately than to emulate his father. But as he grew, he never learned to control his tears. He learned instead to hide whenever he felt their approach.</p><p>The rains awakened something in him. Maybe it was their steady flow that eroded his makeshift stoicism and caused water to gush from his eyes as if from a geyser. What ever the connection, Gus always wept along with the rains. He&#x2019;d convinced himself that the sky, like him, was cursed with a heavy heart that required annual purging. So every spring since his tenth birthday, when the scent of moisture filled his nose he escaped to the Jordan River and stood amid the rain, wailing away pain like a woman in labor. Whether it lasted for hours or even a day, no one expected his return to normalcy until the showers subsided.</p><p>Gus was grateful others didn&#x2019;t ask why he cried, because he couldn&#x2019;t have explained it. Had he known words like "injustice" or "inequity" he might&#x2019;ve been able to translate his feelings into words, but with a third-grade vocabulary, such articulation was out of the question. All he knew was that he cried when things weren&#x2019;t right. He wept as a child when other children mocked his holey shoes, and then he wept when God refused to grant him the courage and the will to fight. He wept for mother birds that couldn&#x2019;t find worms for their young. He wept for cows left freezing in the snow. He wept for Miss Mazie&#x2014;the woman whose husband slashed her with a butcher&#x2019;s mallet for talking back&#x2014;and wept even harder when he overheard that they put the man away. Most of all he wept because he thought people in the world didn&#x2019;t care.</p><p>His hardest days were between the rains. At the most inopportune moments, in the middle of the summer or the bitter cold of winter, he&#x2019;d witness a wrong and water would ooze, unannounced, across his cheeks and he&#x2019;d be forced to retreat into some private place where his tears wouldn&#x2019;t be cause for ridicule. Yet these momentary cleansings never resulted in Gus&#x2019;s complete healing. Only the annual spring rains set his heart aright again, so, after the third grade&#x2014;the end of Gus&#x2019;s formal education&#x2014;he began anticipating the rains&#x2019; arrival. As soon as the first buds bloomed, he&#x2019;d watch the heavens for signs of inclement weather, and when the dark clouds gathered, he&#x2019;d run to the Jordan and welcome the downpour. After 1910, locals noted the beginning of spring when they heard Gus wailing in the distance and, whether out of fear or simple disinterest, no one bothered traveling to the riverbank to see exactly what Gustavus Peace was doing, much less why.</p><p>He needed the rains of 1940 worse than he&#x2019;d ever needed them, for the impending birth of his seventh child&#x2014;the only one he had never wanted&#x2014;incited rage he feared he couldn&#x2019;t restrain. Yet the rains wouldn&#x2019;t come. Each morning he jumped from his sleeping pallet on the floor, sniffing the air like a Labrador retriever, hoping to smell the sweet scent of moisture, only to be disappointed when his nostrils inhaled particles of dry, pungent, red dust. Having never mentioned to his wife, Emma Jean, that he felt deceived by the pregnancy, Gus had waited since her ecstatic November announcement to unleash with the spring rains instead of strangling her. His greatest fear now was that an overflowing heart would cause him to crumble before his sons. Each day, his eyes glazed over and his hands began to tremble, and he cursed the rains for seemingly having abandoned him. So far, he had remained composed, but he knew he wouldn&#x2019;t last much longer.</p><p>When Emma Jean screamed, Gus released the curtain, turned from the window, and looked toward their bedroom. It was really her bedroom, he thought, for he had slept on the floor since learning of her pregnancy. He liked it that way. It kept him from touching her and creating another mouth to feed. He wouldn&#x2019;t have touched her this last time had Emma Jean not convinced him that she couldn&#x2019;t have any more children. Gus asked why, and Emma Jean said that she was going through the change. He didn&#x2019;t know exactly what that meant, but he took her at her word. The day she confessed her pregnancy, Gus nodded and promised in his heart never to touch her again. That would keep the children from coming, he reasoned, and that was exactly what he wanted.</p><p>"Push!" Henrietta coaxed with her hands cupped around the wet, slimy crown of the baby&#x2019;s head.</p><p>Beads of sweat danced across Emma Jean&#x2019;s shiny black forehead as she panted. With borrowed might, she clutched the sheets on which she lay and bellowed, "Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!" tossing her head from one edge of the pillow to the other. "Oh my God! I thought havin&#x2019; a girl"&#x2014;breath&#x2014;"would be easier than havin&#x2019; them big, knucklehead boys."</p><p>Henrietta chuckled. She had delivered almost every child in Conway County, Arkansas, since the 1920s, and if nothing else, she had learned that a baby&#x2019;s gender could never be predicted. "This might be another boy, Emma," she warned softly. "Don&#x2019;t get yo&#x2019; hopes up too high. Plenty women think they havin&#x2019; one thing and have somethin&#x2019; else. Now breathe and push again."</p><p>Emma Jean sighed, refusing to relinquish hope that she was finally birthing the daughter she&#x2019;d always wanted. That hope lent her strength to push again. "AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!" she growled, exposing the rich, deep alto for which folks at St. Matthew No. 3 Baptist Church were grateful. It was this voice that had caught Gus&#x2019;s attention years ago, teasing his soul one Easter Sunday morning with a rendition of "He Rose" that left him tingling inside. He called the feeling love and asked Emma Jean to marry him. That was fifteen years ago. Back when he was a fool, he always said.</p><p>"It won&#x2019;t be long now!" Henrietta encouraged. "Just a few more pushes and we&#x2019;ll have ourselves another baby."</p><p>Emma Jean gripped the iron bars of the headpost and stared at the ceiling, delirious. She wanted to push again, but couldn&#x2019;t find the strength. In the meantime, she wondered if Gus had decided upon a name, since he hadn&#x2019;t liked any of her choices.</p><p>"What about Rose?" she&#x2019;d posed one night, leaning over the edge of the bed.</p><p>Gus grunted something unintelligible and pulled the battered quilt over his head.</p><p>Emma Jean interpreted the response as a no. "Then what about Violet? Or maybe Priscilla?"</p><p>Too sleepy to care, Gus hoped his words would close the matter. "Them don&#x2019;t sound like no colored girls&#x2019; names to me," he murmured. "And, anyway, it&#x2019;s probably gon&#x2019; be a boy, the luck we been havin&#x2019;."</p><p>Emma Jean scoffed. "Just &#x2019;cause a girl be colored don&#x2019;t mean she gotta have no ole, tired, country-soundin&#x2019; name."</p><p>Gus peeked from beneath the quilt. "You got one."</p><p>"I know!" Emma Jean shouted. "But that don&#x2019;t mean my baby gotta have one."</p><p>"Well, it don&#x2019;t make no difference right now noway. The baby ain&#x2019;t even here yet. Good night."</p><p>Emma Jean stopped discussing names with Gus. Why, she wondered, had she consulted a fool in the first place? What would a man know about choosing a baby&#x2019;s name?</p><p>"I got de head in my hands," Henrietta said excitedly. "Just give me one more good push! Come on! You can do it!"</p><p>The dance of the sweat beads devolved into a slow waltz around Emma Jean&#x2019;s thick brows as she lay exhausted upon the feather pillow. Her good, baby blue sheets, which she had intended to remove from the bed in a few days, would now have to be discarded. Thinking she had at least another week before the baby&#x2019;s arrival, she had prioritized other more immediate chores, but when her water broke while she was preparing Sunday breakfast, she knew those sheets were history.</p><p>Gus and the boys sat in the small living room and waited. Knowing no other way to pass the time, Gus read passages from the Bible&#x2014;the few he could read&#x2014;in hopes that something from the Word might still his rumbling heart. He would love the baby, he resolved, but he would never forgive Emma Jean. Never. And if the rains didn&#x2019;t come, he wouldn&#x2019;t forgive them, either.</p><p>Still in their church clothes, which was a clean shirt beneath their work overalls, the boys anticipated the sister they didn&#x2019;t have. Of course another brother would be okay, they agreed silently, but a sister would add spice to an otherwise dull house hold. Mister, the youngest brother, didn&#x2019;t care either way. He simply wanted someone else to be the baby of the family.</p><p>"What if it&#x2019;s a boy?" Mister asked.</p></p><h2>Adventures from the Land of Stories: The Mother Goose Diaries</h2><p><b>Get a front row seat to the adventures of the mischievous Mother Goose, a fan favorite character in the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling series, The Land of Stories.</b><br>Mother Goose has had centuries of adventure and finally she's allowing her favorite readers to take a peek at all her secrets.

Now sharing a room with his younger brother in the wake of his sister's birth, Alex delivers his first written plea to Mom, who, in the depths of postpartum exhaustion, refers him to his father. Thus do Alex and his good-natured dad begin their own guy-to-guy letter exchange, with Alex detailing Ethan's various transgressions (&#x201c;He sticks crayons up his nose and barks like a walrus!&#x201d;) and his reasonable father reminding him that he was no different at the age of four. Back and forth go Alex's complaints and his father's practical rejoinders until Dad suggests that they build a tree house together, where surely Alex can find some peace and quiet. Indeed, it's too quiet&#x2013;and Alex's final letter is to Ethan, inviting him to play in his new retreat. The last page shows the brothers happily ascending the tree-house ladder together. As spun out in the exchanges, the child vs. parent points of view and the sibling rivalry all ring hilariously true. Catrow's zany pencil and watercolor illustrations capture perfectly the madcap daydreams in Alex's head as well as the familiar detritus of a young boy's room. (The iguana still lives there!)

That&#x2019;s the inspiring message of this <i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling picture book biography series from historian and author Brad Meltzer. This volume focuses on Jim Henson, the creator of the Muppets and <i>Sesame Street</i>.</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br>This friendly, fun biography series focuses on the traits that made our heroes great--the traits that kids can aspire to in order to live heroically themselves. Jim Henson, for example, was always dreaming up something new, and always expressing his belief in the goodness of people. Henson was a born performer with a terrific sense of humor, and he used those talents to help create two of the most beloved programs in television history: <i>The Muppet Show</i> and <i>Sesame Street</i>. Through his Muppets, Jim showed the world that there&#x2019;s nothing more beautiful than imagination, especially when it&#x2019;s accompanied by laughter and kindness.<br> &nbsp;<br> Each book in this series tells the story of one inspiring individual through lively text and art that works well for the youngest nonfiction readers. At the back are an excellent timeline and photos.</p><p>Brad Meltzer is the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>Heroes for My Son</i>,&nbsp;<i>Heroes for My Daughter</i>, and a number of suspense novels for adults. He is also the host of the History Channel television shows&nbsp;<i>Brad Meltzer&#x2019;s Decoded</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Lost History</i>.

He lives in New Jersey with his wife and their identical twin sons.Gr 1&#x2013;3&#x2014;A brief but entertaining introduction to Muppets creator Jim Henson. The text, narrated by Henson, presents his life story as if he were still alive but as a child version of himself (complete with a beard!). The factual information provided is solid, as is the back matter, which includes a time line of Henson's life and a few photographs. Some readers may be a bit perplexed when the time line reveals that Henson passed away in 1990. However, the effect of a miniature Henson narrating his own story is charming. The graphic novel&#x2014;style illustrations are friendly, with speech bubbles and factoids peppered throughout.

Eating Disorders Anonymous (EDA), founded by sober members of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), have produced a work that emulates the &#x201c;Big Book&#x201d; in style and substance. EDA respects the pioneering work of AA while expanding its Twelve-Step message of hope to include those who are religious or seek a spiritual solution, and for those who are not and may be more comfortable substituting &#x201c;higher purpose&#x201d; for the traditional &#x201c;Higher Power.&#x201d; Further, the EDA approach embraces the development and maintenance of balance and perspective, rather than abstinence, as the goal of recovery.<br><br>Initial chapters provide clear directions on how to establish a foothold in recovery by offering one of the founder&#x2019;s story of hope, and collective voices tell why EDA is suitable for readers with any type of problem eating, including: anorexia nervosa, bulimia, binge eating, emotional eating, and orthorexia. The text then explains how to use the Twelve Steps to develop a durable and resilient way of thinking and acting that is free of eating disordered thoughts and behaviors, including how to pay it forward so that others might have hope of recovery.<br><br>In the second half of the text, individual contributors share their experiences, describing what it was like to have an eating disorder, what happened that enabled them to make a start in recovery, and what it is like to be in recovery. Like the &#x201c;Big Book,&#x201d; these stories are in three sections: Pioneers of EDA, They Stopped in Time, and They Lost Nearly All.<br><br>Readers using the Twelve Steps to recover from other issues will find the process consistent and reinforcing of their experiences, yet the EDA approach offers novel ideas and specific guidance for those struggling with food, weight and body image issues. Letters of support from three, highly-regarded medical professionals and two, well-known recovery advocates offer reassurance that EDA&#x2019;s approach is consistent with that supported by medical research and standards in the field of eating disorders treatment.<br><br>Intended as standard reading for members who participate in EDA groups throughout the world, this book is accessible and appropriate for anyone who wants to recover from an eating disorder or from issues related to food, weight, and body image.</p><p>The General Service Board of <b>Eating Disorders Anonymous (EDA)</b> is an organization formed to support the Fellowship of EDA and EDA groups in fulfilling their primary purpose, to carry the message of recovery to those who still suffer with eating disorders. <br></p><h2>Cool Builds in Minecraft!: An AFK Book (GamesMaster Presents)</h2><p>Get building today!

Carrie&#x2019;s handmade biscuits combine unique, brilliant flavors&#x2014;sharp cheddar with fresh chives, cracked black pepper with cream cheese and green onions, and cinnamon biscuits so buttery they melt in your mouth.

In fact, I never even made biscuits until I was in my thirties. So as you begin to delve into this book and into biscuit making, do not be intimidated by the idea of making amazing biscuits! I know it&#x2019;s a clich�, but in this case it&#x2019;s apt: If I can do it, you can do it.<br> <br>Growing up, I watched my mother and her mother make biscuits from our family recipe, but I&#x2019;d never made them myself until I twisted my mother&#x2019;s arm into starting a company with me called Callie&#x2019;s Charleston Biscuits. Baking was not even something I particularly enjoyed at the time, but I figured I could run the business and sales end of Callie&#x2019;s and she could be in charge of the baking. And that&#x2019;s how it went those first couple of years. I would occasionally help out with the biscuit making, but to be honest it was more like going through the motions and doing as I was told rather than putting my heart and soul into it or feeling all that engaged in the process itself.<br> <br>Then my mom decided to retire.<br> <br>This had not been a part of my business plan! Suddenly the landscape of the business shifted, and I was going to have to redouble my efforts. But I was the kind of cook who never measured anything, who loved to improvise and experiment. Biscuits require accuracy, uniformity, and repetition. How in the world could I captain the ship when I didn&#x2019;t know how to sail?<br> <br>So I dug in, scared as hell, and turned to my employees to teach me how to master every aspect of making the absolute best biscuits. With the business on the line, my previous ambivalence about baking turned into a determined passion. I had to become a baker, and so I did. And I found out I loved it. Almost more than running the business. Making biscuits became second nature to me and now it&#x2019;s as therapeutic as chopping onions and planning menus always have been. Running the business now, I do not get in there with the bakers as much as I&#x2019;d like&#x2014;but when I can, I do, and I fit right in. My hands know what to do. And I find myself making biscuits at home with my daughters as well. Before, the thought of making biscuits was daunting, but I now get the urge to make them.<br> <br>Once you get the technique down, your hands, too, will begin to feel as if they&#x2019;re moving of their own accord. What at first may seem intimidating and infinitely messy will become ritual . . . and maybe a little less messy.<br> <br>Whether I&#x2019;m performing this ritual with my daughters, my mother, or the Callie&#x2019;s bakers (my other family!), the process always takes on a life of its own after a while. As we plunge our hands into bowls to work the wet dough and roll it out and line the biscuits across the pans, we&#x2019;re telling stories about our day, talking about everything from a recipe conundrum to whom we ran into at the grocery store, and sometimes even airing a grievance or two. When you get to that point with your biscuit making that it becomes almost automatic, you&#x2019;ll be able to concentrate less on each step and more on the conversation and togetherness with your family and friends in the kitchen. And you&#x2019;ll be able to add your own twist to the technique.<br> <br>Above all, don&#x2019;t worry. If you follow the steps, you really can&#x2019;t mess up biscuits. Biscuits are forgiving. They will get better the more you make them and the techniques will get easier. They&#x2019;re not delicate like a pastry. It&#x2019;s okay if they&#x2019;re not perfectly round or they&#x2019;re a little on the big side. So don&#x2019;t put too much pressure on yourself! Enjoy the process and the taste. The presentation will improve.<br> <br>I eventually felt ready to experiment with my mother&#x2019;s biscuit recipe, and my first success was my black pepper biscuits. Several of the recipes in the chapter on biscuit making are deliberate variations on the original technique passed down to me. Keep repeating the basic process and you can use the dough and the technique as your canvas to create your own family recipes based on your personal palate and favorite ingredients.<br> <br>My hope for sharing the gift of biscuit making is to bring a little bit of the old-fashioned baking practices from my grandmothers and mother (those techniques I really never thought I&#x2019;d master) to your kitchen counter. Even though you&#x2019;re busy, you can enjoy and share these delicious treats. A biscuit is such a tiny little thing, but it has brought a lot to my life, and I hope it can bring goodness to yours as well. There&#x2019;s nothing tastier than a hot one right out of the oven, and that taste is enhanced exponentially by the quality&#x2014;not necessarily the quantity&#x2014;of time spent preparing it. For me, there is something indescribably rewarding about creating something so wonderful from such simple ingredients. Something that brings a smile to those I love. It&#x2019;s what makes me want to do it over and over again.<br> <br>Do I ever get sick of biscuits? No. Would it be an exaggeration to say my life revolves around biscuits? I don&#x2019;t think so. Because for me, biscuits are more than just the end product of the hand mixing, rolling, cutting, and baking. Biscuits are a living legacy of my family history and the women who&#x2019;ve gone before me, and with each batch of biscuits I make I&#x2019;m refining and passing along this legacy to my daughters. Biscuits and family are as inextricably linked in my life as butter and flour. Put them together and something magical happens.<br> <br>You could even say that &#x201c;family&#x201d; is the secret ingredient to all my best recipes, not just the biscuits. I like to say, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all about the food.&#x201d; That &#x201c;all the rest&#x201d; is just extra. But as I thought long and hard about my favorite recipes and techniques and which ones to include in this book, I quickly realized it was people who popped inside my head even before the food. My mother&#x2019;s biscuits, my Mama&#x2019;s pineapple upside down cake, my grandmother&#x2019;s macaroni pie. Even plain boiled shrimp was Dad&#x2019;s boiled shrimp. And each recipe brought a story to mind with it. I really couldn&#x2019;t tell you about Dad&#x2019;s boiled shrimp without telling you about the time his boat and trailer rolled into the creek pulling my grandfather&#x2019;s station wagon with it, or about my mother&#x2019;s perfect tomato sandwiches without telling you about summers spent at the lake with her and her parents, and my grandfather singing Tony Bennett songs to my grandmother.<br><br><br> <br>Rebecca Maxcey Bailey<br><br>This passing down of recipes and traditions, this legacy I&#x2019;ve inherited, it turns out, is less about the food on the table and more about the people sitting around it&#x2014;and you wouldn&#x2019;t serve just any food to your favorite people! I serve the food I love, the food I crave to taste and can&#x2019;t wait to make. And as I pass this food with pride down my table of family and friends, I pass along the stories and love of the people who gave it to me.<br><br><br> <br>Caroline Macdowell Hartzog<br><br>So who are these people who give me inspiration, stories, and the best food I ever tasted? Well, they are far-flung but extremely tight, diverse in opinion but loyal to one another, and they all treasure gathering around the table for good food and lively conversation. I lived with my father after my parents split up when I was very young, and then both of my parents married wonderful people. My father and stepmother, Caroline, had a son, Alston, and my mother and stepfather, Tom, had two sons, Kinnon and Miles, so I have three amazing brothers who are a good bit younger than I am. And I have wonderful cousins, aunts, and uncles on all sides. My husband, John, is my perfect match, and we have three girls, Caroline, Cate, and Sarah. I have so many good friends who might as well be family and whose company, stories, and recipes are dear to me as well.<br> <br>But the matriarchs whose recipes and talents started it all and who laid the foundation for the legacy I hope to build on are my two grandmothers: my father&#x2019;s mother, Mama (pronounced mama), and my mother&#x2019;s mother, Grandmama (pronounced grandmomma). They couldn&#x2019;t have been more different, and yet they nurtured me, taught me, and fed me with the same degree of love and wisdom.<br> <br>Mama came from humble roots, but she was a queen in her kitchen. She was one of ten children and with her husband of sixty-six years had six herself: one stillborn baby girl followed by five boys. She never got her driver&#x2019;s license. With five boys and a husband, as my uncle says, it didn&#x2019;t matter whether it was because she loved to cook or there were so many mouths to feed, she was in her kitchen all the time. She was so proud of her boys and loved to watch them play football. Two even earned football scholarships, my father to the University of South Carolina and his youngest brother to The Citadel. There wasn&#x2019;t a lot of money, but she made up for that with love&#x2014;and plenty of good food. She was a gentle yet incredibly strong woman who was so proud of her children and grandchildren. I miss her.<br> <br>Grandmama was a fabulous, fabulous cook. She was born and raised in Gaffney, South Carolina, married my grandfather when she was nineteen, and was married for fifty-eight happy years. She was extraordinarily beautiful, bohemian, sophisticated, and intelligent. She taught my mother how to make elegantly small Southern biscuits, and my mother passed her recipes and techniques down to me. Too many of her recipes remain in memory only, as she hardly ever wrote anything down, but I love that trying to re-create them has become a collaborative effort for my girls and me. Maybe in this case the continued conversation about them and the multiple attempts to replicate them makes her legacy even more alive.<br> <br>My mother, Callie, is the namesake of my business, and her attention to detail and knowing just the right thing to do or fix set a high bar. She is a phenomenal cook, incredibly fashionable, and absolutely gorgeous. She is very liberal and feisty and deep down a true Southern woman despite her worldly ways. I am always asking her for advice on menus, recipes, and entertaining. She&#x2019;s creative and has amazing taste and makes fabulous beautiful food. Even a sandwich tastes better when she makes it!<br> <br>My father, Donald, is incredibly driven and never takes no for an answer. He grew up in an extremely poor household, and it was only due to his considerable athletic talent that he was able to attend college. He has always taught me to think &#x201c;I can&#x201d; and &#x201c;I will&#x201d; and has always encouraged and supported me. He&#x2019;s my ultimate hero, and he touches everyone he knows in a positive light.<br> <br>So as you can see, I come from two very different Southern families. While Grandmama hosted elegant parties, a special occasion at Mama&#x2019;s meant I got to eat at a TV table; I inherited Mama&#x2019;s cast-iron skillet and Grandmama&#x2019;s silver gravy boat. I treasure these women, their wisdom, and their culinary gifts in equal measure, and I hope I make a nice blend of both traditions.<br> <br>In fact, the dichotomy of my mother&#x2019;s and father&#x2019;s family influences on me is an issue I laugh about almost daily. The other day I was making pickled shrimp for a Carolina tailgate, and sitting there peeling shrimp and deveining each and every one, I was thinking how my dad would no more think of deveining a shrimp than fly to the moon, and my mom would not even consider looking at a shrimp unless it had been deveined&#x2014;and that about sums it up: my life in a shrimp shell!<br> <br>My mom would probably say about my cooking and entertaining style that I don&#x2019;t put enough effort into the details. My dad would say I&#x2019;m too fancy. Luckily, my husband thinks I&#x2019;m the perfect mix. I try to take the best of all my influences&#x2014;all my heirlooms&#x2014;and make them my own to share with my friends, my husband, and my daughters. I think of myself as somewhere in the middle between fancy and basic, sophistication and salt of the earth: I give my oyster roasts a little flair and my cocktail parties an air of simplicity; I put out boiled peanuts right next to chilled Champagne; and once or twice I may have served Bloody Marys while I was still in my pajamas. I find that there&#x2019;s always a reason to make an ordinary meal a special occasion and always a way to give a special occasion the comfortable, laid-back feel of an ordinary family meal.<br> <br><br> <br>I hope that reading this cookbook, you&#x2019;ll be able to take what I share and make it your own, and that some of these recipes will find a place at your family table. And maybe it isn&#x2019;t all about the food or making tiny little biscuits, but good food and biscuits isn&#x2019;t such a bad place to start, either.<br> <br><br> <br> FAVORITE TOOLS<p></p> <br><br>JUICE GLASS<br> <br>At Callie&#x2019;s we use two-inch aluminum biscuit cutters, but at home my girls and I use a juice glass. Test some of your juice glasses or shot glasses to see which you like best. Dip the open end in flour to keep it from sticking, and then press out the biscuits from the dough. Not only does this save you from buying and storing yet another kitchen gadget&#x2014;you&#x2019;re creating a family heirloom. Pretty soon that juice glass will come to be known as the biscuit glass.<br> <br><br><br>ROLLING PIN<br> <br>At Callie&#x2019;s we use French rolling pins with tapered ends, made from one piece of wood. At our house in Idaho, my rolling pin is the more traditional model with handles. But don&#x2019;t get hung up over this tool. In a pinch I&#x2019;ve used a wine bottle. In fact, any cylinder will do. If you are using an improvised rolling pin, put parchment paper between the dough and the cylinder to protect the dough.<br><br>DIGITAL THERMOMETER<br> <br>You only need one thermometer whether you&#x2019;re frying, cooking a roast, or making candy. But it needs to be a good one with a probe attached by a cable. This tool is worth it. It takes away so much guesswork and frustration. It is my best friend when I am frying&#x2014;I consult it the whole time. With mine, I can set the desired temperature and then leave the temperature probe in whatever is cooking, and when the temperature is reached, it beeps. So much better than standing around holding a thermometer and watching the numbers move. I do not have time for that.<br><br>OVEN THERMOMETER<br> <br>You&#x2019;d be surprised how inaccurate most oven thermostats are. Especially with biscuits, piecrusts, and cookies, you want to make sure you&#x2019;re not sabotaging yourself with an oven that runs hot or cold. Use an inexpensive oven thermometer to keep tabs on the real oven temperature, and if the thermostat turns out to be pretty far off, call a repairperson to recalibrate it for you.<br><br>TONGS<br> <br>I have maybe five pairs of tongs in different sizes, and I keep them within easy reach in a bin on my counter. I use them for everything from flipping fried chicken to picking up hot bacon to pulling meat out of its bag of marinade without making a mess. Get a nice pair that will last. The springs often break in the cheap ones.<br><br>CHARLESTON RICE STEAMER<br> <br>Mama always had a pot of butter beans and a steamer full of rice on the stove&#x2014;no matter the time of day or the meal being served. She put soup over rice, okra and tomatoes over rice, and served butter beans over rice with almost everything. Rice in her house was a constant companion to any dish. And even though Mama lived on rural Johns Island in a...</p><h2>Aacn Essentials of Critical Care Nursing, Fourth Edition</h2><p><b>Publisher's Note: Products purchased from Third Party sellers are not guaranteed by the publisher for quality,&nbsp;authenticity, or access to any online entitlements included with the product.</b><br><b><br></b><br><b>Succinct, complete guidance on how to safely and competently care for adult, critically ill patients and their families &#x2013; written by top clinical experts&nbsp;</b><br><br><p><b><i>A Doody&#x2019;s Core Title for 2019!&nbsp;</i></b></p><br>Endorsed by the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses (AACN), this acclaimed textbook sets the standard for critical care nursing education.

An international bestseller, a nominee for the National Book Critics Circle Award, and made into a critically acclaimed movie, Shilts' expose revealed why AIDS was allowed to spread unchecked during the early 80's while the most trusted institutions ignored or denied the threat. One of the few true modern classics, it changed and framed how AIDS was discussed in the following years. Now republished in a special 20th Anniversary edition, <i>And the Band Played On</i> remains one of the essential books of our time.</p><p>In the first major book on AIDS, San Francisco Chronicle reporter Randy Shilts examines the making of an epidemic. Shilts researched and reported the book exhaustively, chronicling almost day-by-day the first five years of AIDS. His work is critical of the medical and scientific communities&#39; initial response and particularly harsh on the Reagan Administration, who he claims cut funding, ignored calls for action and deliberately misled Congress. Shilts doesn&#39;t stop there, wondering why more people in the gay community, the mass media and the country at large didn&#39;t stand up in anger more quickly. The AIDS pandemic is one of the most striking developments of the late 20th century and this is the definitive story of its beginnings.<p>RANDY SHILTS was one of the first journalists to recognize AIDS as an important national issue and, in the early 1980s, he began to report on AIDS full time for the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, making him the only journalist to do so. He was also the author of <i>The Mayor of Castro Street: The Life and Times of Harvey Milk</i> and <i>Conduct Unbecoming: Gay and Lesbians in the U.S. Military. </i> Shilts died of AIDS-related complications in early 1994.</p></p><h2>Bad Kitty Meets the Baby (paperback black-and-white edition)</h2><p><p>Kitty's owners are home with a big surprise for Kitty.

In his gently written picture book, children will see firsthand how much fun making new friends can be. Loaded with real pictures of friends having fun together, this will help any early reader get excited about meeting new people.</p><p>Producer, magician, writer, puppeteer, minister, husband, father, Fred Rogers started out in children's television thirty years ago. The direction he trailblazed was the "creation of television programming that spoke, with respect, to the concerns of early childhood, not as adults see it but as children feel it."<p>He has received virtually every major award in the television industry for work in his field, and dozens of others from special-interest groups.</p><p>Fred Rogers lives in Pennsylvania.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>PreSchool-Grade 1 Children beginning ``to share themselves with others'' as they change from playing side by side to playing together is the theme of Making Friends. In it a preschool boy and girl are shown squabbling over toys and struggling to be first on the slide ladder, as well as sharing laughs, secrets, and tea parties. The soothing text explains how friends can make you feel left out, angry, and sad and also how they can bring joy and variety into life. A multitude of successful books on friendship is available, but as a child-oriented psychological commentary on its meaning, this excels. Moving examines the fears, sadnesses, and excitements of a boy about three years old when he leaves one house and set of friends for another. He is shown helping to pack, meeting the movers, settling into his new room, exploring his new neighborhood, and telephoning an old friend. The large, brightly-colored photographs in both books are very natural in their depiction of children in play clothes in everyday settings. In Making Friends all ethnic groups are depicted, and one child wears thick glasses. Both formats are well-designed and varied, with large clear print. The writing is gentle, empathetic, and conversational. It encourages communication with parents and friends. Altogether, text and pictures in both books exude a knowledgeable reassurance designed to comfort both child and parent in potentially traumatic situations. These two books should be available to everyone who works with preschoolers.

It&#x2019;s a terrible mess, and that&#x2019;s putting it mildly. There has never been a more dangerous time. The politicians and special interests in Washington, DC are directly responsible for the mess we are in. So why should we continue listening to them?<br><br>It&#x2019;s time to bring America back to its rightful owners&#x2014;the American people.<br> <br> I&#x2019;m not going to play the same game politicians have been playing for decades&#x2014;all talk, no action, while special interests and lobbyists dictate our laws. I am shaking up the establishment on both sides of the political aisle because I can&#x2019;t be bought. I want to bring America back, to make it great and prosperous again, and to be sure we are respected by our allies and feared by our adversaries.<br> <br> It&#x2019;s time for action. Americans are fed up with politics as usual. And they should be! In this book, I outline my vision to make America great again, including: how to fix our failing economy; how to reform health care so it is more efficient, cost-effective, and doesn&#x2019;t alienate both doctors and patients; how to rebuild our military and start winning wars&#x2014;instead of watching our enemies take over&#x2014;while keeping our promises to our great veterans; how to ensure that our education system offers the resources that allow our students to compete internationally, so tomorrow&#x2019;s jobseekers have the tools they need to succeed; and how to immediately bring jobs back to America by closing our doors to illegal immigrants, and pressuring businesses to produce their goods at home.<br> <br> This book is my blueprint for how to Make America Great Again. It&#x2019;s not hard. We just need someone with the courage to say what needs to be said.</p><p>Donald J. Trump is the very definition of the American success story, continually setting the standards of excellence while expanding his interests in real estate, sports, and entertainment. He is a graduate of the Wharton School of Finance. An accomplished author, Mr. Trump has authored over fifteen bestsellers and his first book, <i>The Art of the Deal</i>, is considered a business classic and one of the most successful business books of all time. Mr. Trump has over eight million followers on social media and is a frequent guest across a variety of media platforms.Crippled America PREFACE<p></p> <br><br> YOU GOTTA BELIEVE<p></p> <br>PEOPLE SAY THAT I have self-confidence. Who knows?<br> <br>When I began speaking out, I was a realist.<br> <br>I knew the relentless and incompetent naysayers of the status quo would anxiously line up against me, and they have:<br> <br>The politicians who talk a great game in campaigns&#x2014;and play like total losers when they try to actually govern because they can&#x2019;t govern; they don&#x2019;t know how to govern.<br> <br>The lobbyists and special interests with their hands in our pockets on behalf of their clients or others.<br> <br>The members of the media who are so far lost when it comes to being fair that they have no concept of the difference between &#x201c;fact&#x201d; and &#x201c;opinion.&#x201d;<br> <br>The illegal immigrants who have taken jobs that should go to people here legally, while over 20 percent of Americans are currently unemployed or underemployed. Believe me, they&#x2019;re all over the place. I see them. I talk to them. I hug them. I hold them. They are all over the place.<br> <br>Congress, which has been deadlocked for years and virtually unable to deal with any of our most pressing domestic problems, or even the most basic ones, such as passing a �budget. Think of it: a little thing like passing the budget. They don&#x2019;t even have a clue.<br> <br>Meanwhile, the bedrock of this country&#x2014;the middle class&#x2014;and those 45 million Americans stuck in poverty have seen their incomes decline over the past 20 years. Understandably, their disenchantment and frustration at what&#x2019;s happening grows every day, and it gets worse and worse and worse.<br> <br>And even our lawyers and judges, the reflective &#x201c;wise men,&#x201d; have been stepping all over the US Constitution, the bulwark of our democracy. They have recklessly appointed themselves to be policy makers, because our actual elected officials are paralyzed by partisanship. They can&#x2019;t move; they can&#x2019;t act. They are totally impotent.<br> <br>As for the presidency and the executive branch, the incompetence is beyond belief.<br> <br>As I write this, Russian president Vladimir Putin is totally outmaneuvering our president by putting together a coalition in Syria that will make Putin the only effective leader in the world. He and his allies&#x2014;most notably Iran&#x2014;have positioned themselves exactly where President Obama and our military have failed miserably for years. They are total failures. They are not leaders. We are no longer a leader. Putin has become the leader, and it&#x2019;s an embarassment to our country.<br> <br>We&#x2019;ve wasted literally trillions of dollars in the Middle East, with virtually nothing to show for it except for alienating our best ally, Israel. To make matters worse, we&#x2019;ve negotiated a worthless and costly nuclear treaty with Iran (now Russia&#x2019;s best friend) on the supposition that it will lead to greater harmony and world peace, which it won&#x2019;t. It will lead to just the opposite.<br> <br>The idea of American Greatness, of our country as the leader of the free and unfree world, has vanished.<br> <br>Despite all of these challenges&#x2014;and actually because of the challenges&#x2014;I decided to do something about it. I couldn&#x2019;t stand to see what was happening to our great country. This mess calls for leadership in the worst way. It needs someone with common sense and business acumen, someone who can truly lead America back to what has made us great in the past. <br> <br>We need someone with a proven track record in business who understands greatness, someone who can rally us to the standard of excellence we once epitomized and explain what needs to be done.<br> <br>When I started speaking out, I had no idea what the reaction would be. I know I&#x2019;m a great builder, I&#x2019;ve built buildings all over the world. I&#x2019;ve had tremendous success. But I hadn&#x2019;t fully exposed my political thoughts and ideas to restore America&#x2019;s greatness.<br> <br>I also knew that the Trump brand is one of the world&#x2019;s great icons of quality and excellence. Everybody talks about it. Everybody knows about it. It&#x2019;s very very special. I&#x2019;m very proud of it. Our buildings and resorts now stand very proudly (and beautifully) all over the United States and in many other countries.<br> <br>I started with the issue of illegal immigration, and proposed building a major wall that would be very high and completely impervious to the flood of immigrants who we don&#x2019;t want or need here illegally. We love people coming in, but not when it&#x2019;s done illegally.<br> <br>Suddenly, Americans started to wake up to what was going on with regard to illegal immigration. Despite the large number of candidates who were running for the Republican nomination, what I was saying started to really hit home with people, and �everybody picked it up and they picked it up gladly.<br> <br>I started drawing crowds so large that we had to move our rallies into football stadiums and convention centers. The first national debate drew 24 million viewers, which set a record for cable television. Despite some of the ridiculous, antagonistic questions&#x2014;or maybe because of them&#x2014;I fought back as I always do and began to explain my vision. As a result, most people thought I won the debate.<br> <br>People were applauding. All of a sudden, people who had never cared about elections or never voted were rushing to our rallies. The rallies became massive. The crowds were unbelievable. The enthusiasm was based on pure love and love of what we were doing.<br> <br>The media, the politicians, and the so-called leaders of our country reacted in horror. But I persevered and went directly to the people, because I don&#x2019;t need anyone&#x2019;s financial support, nor do I need anyone&#x2019;s approval of what I say or do. I just had to do the right thing. I had to do it. I had no choice. I see what&#x2019;s happening to our country; it&#x2019;s going to hell. I had to do it.<br> <br>I have now begun to fill in some of the details of my vision. I&#x2019;ve released a tax plan that gives the middle class and those with lower incomes a chance to keep more of what they earn, while restructuring how the richest Americans will be paying taxes.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve committed to a truly more powerful military, one prepared and equipped to stand up to any and all of our foes. When we draw a line in the sand, it needs to mean something to all&#x2014;�especially our enemies.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve introduced a whole new approach to job creation by encouraging companies to bring more of their jobs and manufacturing back to America (home where it belongs), along with the trillions of dollars currently being held in foreign banks overseas. We&#x2019;re bringing that money back. It&#x2019;s a massive amount of money. And guess what? Lots of good things are going to happen. They&#x2019;re going to spend that money on roads, on bridges, on companies, on jobs. It&#x2019;s going to be amazing.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve explained why Obamacare is a costly, ludicrous solution to our health care woes and one which must be repealed and replaced with a much better option. We need to fix the problem by creating competition in the private sector between insurance companies, and by allowing patients to choose the family doctors they want. This will be a much better plan, a much less costly plan&#x2014;better doctors, better service. It will be something really special. And think of it: the United States will save a fortune as a country. People will be better served. A combination that cannot be beat.<br> <br>Competition is a magic word in education as well. Parents should have the right to choose the schools where their kids can get the best education. The weaker schools will be closed, and ineffective teachers will be fired. One-size-fits-all �education&#x2014;Common Core&#x2014;is bad. It&#x2019;s not going to happen. We don&#x2019;t want our children to be educated from Washington. We want local education. Education should be �locally based.<br> <br>Domestically, we need to undertake a massive rebuilding of our infrastructure. Too many bridges have become dangerous, our roads are decaying and full of potholes, while traffic jams are costing millions in lost income for drivers who have jobs in congested cities. Public transit is overcrowded and unreliable and our airports must be rebuilt. You go to countries like China and many others and you look at their train systems and their public transport. It&#x2019;s so much better. We&#x2019;re like a third-world country.<br> <br>I could go on and on regarding many of the ideas I&#x2019;ve written about in this book, and more that will be forthcoming. But let me add that while my critics are pushing their policy agendas, the last thing we need are more plans that evaporate after the elections.<br> <br>What we need is leadership that can deal with our mess and begin to apply practical solutions to our problems. My goal is not to design hundreds of pages of government regulation and red tape like others propose. We need to outline �commonsense policies and then knock some heads together if necessary to make them work. The fact is we are over-regulated. People can&#x2019;t move. They&#x2019;re stymied. Companies can&#x2019;t be built. We&#x2019;re over-regulated.<br> <br>I know how to deal with complex issues and how to bring together all the various elements necessary for success. I&#x2019;ve done it for years and have built a great company and a massive net worth.<br> <br>This book is designed to give the reader a better understanding of me and my ideas for our future. I&#x2019;m a really nice guy, believe me, I pride myself on being a nice guy but I&#x2019;m also passionate and determined to make our country great again.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s time we turn America around from despair and anger to joy and accomplishment. It can happen, and it will happen. <br> <br>Our best days still lie ahead. There is so much untapped greatness in our country. We&#x2019;re rich in natural resources, and we&#x2019;re rich in human talent.<br> <br>Enjoy this book&#x2014;and together, let&#x2019;s make America great again!</p><h2>The Misfits</h2><p>Sticks and stones<br> may break our bones,<br> but names<br> will break our spirit.</p><p>The Misfits is a multi-voiced recording narrated by Spencer Murphy and the talented Full Cast Audio family of actors.

As organizations face more complex interdependent tasks, leadership must become more personal in order to insure open trusting communication that will make more collaborative problem solving and innovation possible. Without open and trusting communications throughout organizations, they will continue to face the productivity and quality problems that result from reward systems that emphasize individual competition and "climbing the corporate ladder". Authors Edgar Schein and Peter Schein recognize this reality and call for a reimagined form of leadership that coincides with emerging trends of relationship building, complex group work, diverse workforces, and cultures in which everyone feels psychologically safe. Humble Leadership calls for "here and now" humility based on a deeper understanding of the constantly evolving complexities of interpersonal, group and intergroup relationships that require shifting our focus towards the process of group dynamics and collaboration. Humble Leadership at all levels and in all working groups will be the key to achieving the creativity, adaptiveness, and agility that organizations will need to survive and grow.</p><p><b>Edgar H.

This compact and lively volume shows why organizations cannot thrive on impersonal interactions, but instead require higher-order relationships that engender trust and honest conversation. Presenting fundamental principles and many instructive examples, it also provides very practical guidance about how to establish such relationships.

What does it take to be the best in the world at your sport? <br><br> Rafael Nadal has the answers. In his memoir, written with award-winning journalist John Carlin, he reveals the secrets of his game and shares the inspiring personal story behind his success. <br><br> It begins in Mallorca, where the tight-knit Nadal family has lived for generations. Coached by his uncle Toni from the age of four and taught humility and respect by his parents, Nadal has managed the uncommon feat of becoming an acclaimed global celebrity while remaining a gracious, hardworking role model for people in all walks of life.<br><br> Now he takes us behind the scenes, from winning the Wimbledon 2008 final-described by John McEnroe as "the greatest game of tennis" he had ever seen-to the family problems that brought him low in 2009 and the numerous injuries that have threatened his career.<br><br> With candor and intelligence, Nadal brings readers on his dramatic and triumphant journey, never losing sight of the prize he values above all others: the unity and love of his family. <br><br> From RAFA:<br><br> "During a match, you are in a permanent battle to fight back your everyday vulnerabilities, bottle up your human feelings. The more bottled up they are, the greater your chances of winning, so long as you've trained as hard as you play and the gap in talent is not too wide between you and your rival. The gap in talent with Federer existed, but it was not impossibly wide. It was narrow enough, even on his favorite surface in the tournament he played best, for me to know that if I silenced the doubts and fears, and exaggerated hopes, inside my head better than he did, I could beat him. You have to cage yourself in protective armor, turn yourself into a bloodless warrior. It's a kind of self-hypnosis, a game you play, with deadly seriousness, to disguise your own weaknesses from yourself, as well as from your rival."<br></p><p><strong>Rafael Nadal</strong> was born in 1986 in Mallorca, Spain. Currently ranked #1 in the world, he has won 9 Grand Slam titles and a career "Golden Slam" all four majors plus a gold medal at the 2008 Olympics. He lives in Mallorca, Spain.<br><br> <strong>John Carlin</strong>, originally from the UK, is currently a Senior International writer for El Pais, the world's leading Spanish-language newspaper.

It is hard to imagine how Nadal could have done any more to get the best out of his own raw material.

Onion and avocado skins, chamomile and birch bark, and nettles and acorns can produce lovely, ethereal colors and effects. The Wild Dyer demystifies this eco-conscious art, focusing on foraging and growing dying materials; repurposing kitchen trimmings; making and using long-lasting dyes; and creating stitched projects. Workspace setup, equipment, and fabric choices and care are all discussed. Beautiful photographs and easy-to-follow instructions illustrate how to make eight exquisite household items, from a drawstring bag to a gardener&#39;s smock and a reversible patchwork blanket. The Wild Dyer is a complete guide for both beginners and experienced artists seeking to expand their knowledge of this increasingly popular craft.</p><p>Abigail Booth is the London-based cofounder of the studio collective Forest + Found. Working across textiles, drawing, and painting, she exhibits her art throughout the world."In this book, [Abigail Booth] clearly outlines natural dye techniques and simple stitches. Coffee grounds, avocado stones, onion skins and nettles all harbour the potential to produce vividly coloured dyes. Follow her instructions to make a gardener's smock dyed with rudbeckia flowers or a pretty pink blanket from willow leaves and birch bark. Reading Abigail's book is like taking a pleasing step back in time." <br> - House &amp; Garden<br><br>"Fine artist Booth often uses natural dyes in her textile pieces, and here takes the reader through the entire process of dyeing with plants and food scraps. Eight sewing projects showcase ways to utilize hand-dyed fabric in household items such as coasters, bags, and cushions. As hand dyeing can create unique effects and as plant dyeing can result in sometimes unexpected shades (avocado skins and stones result in a surprisingly vibrant shade of pink), samples of the range of colors any dye ingredient can create are beautifully photographed alongside the plant ingredients." <br> - Booklist<br><br>"Booth expounds on the benefits of using naturally dyed fabric in this easy-to-follow and richly illustrated how-to. Using natural dyes, she writes, encourages "a wonderful relationship with the outdoors." Booth's scrupulousness takes the mystery out of the cloth-dyeing process and leaves crafters with a well-appointed resource to an appealing new pursuit." <br> - Publishers Weekly<br><br>"[Abigail Booth] hopes to share her excitement about the freedom of natural dyeing processes in her new book, The Wild Dyer, which follows the same course as Abigail's own journey - starting in the kitchen, before taking you outside to show you what you can forage and what you can grow yourself. Woven throughout are beautiful sewing projects; a foraging bag, a gardener's smock, a dyer's apron." <br> - The Sunday Telegraph (UK)<br><br>"Take a journey with Abigail Booth as she teaches you the foundations of natural dyeing and guides you through simple steps to create unique projects.

Like most of us, the answers handed down to them didn&#x2019;t seem to work in the real world. But when they met Jesus, things immediately started to change for them. It seems he not only <i>had</i> the answers&#x2014;he <i>was</i> the answer. In <i>Encounters with Jesus</i>, Timothy Keller shows how&nbsp;the central events and meetings in Jesus&#x2019; life can change our own lives forever.<br><br>"Keller's work belongs on the bookshelf of every serious Bible student." &#x2014;Examiner<br><br>"Keller has mined the gold from these texts of Scripture, and any Christian is bound to have their minds expanded and hearts stirred." &#x2014;Grace for Sinners</p><p><b>Timothy Keller</b>&nbsp;was born and raised in Pennsylvania and educated at Bucknell University, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary, and Westminster Theological Seminary. His first pastorate was in Hopewell, Virginia. In 1989 he started Redeemer Presbyterian Church in New York City with his wife, Kathy, and their three sons. Today, Redeemer has nearly six thousand regular Sunday attendees and has helped to start more than three hundred new churches around the world.

In these groups the leader would not take the role of teacher or instructor; instead he or she would facilitate the entire group&#x2019;s reading and interpreta�tion of the chosen Bible text. The ground rules were simple but crucial for the integrity of the exercise. The Bible was to be given the benefit of the doubt&#x2014;�the text was to be treated as reliable and its authors as competent. No one person&#x2019;s inter�pretation was to be imposed on the passage; we were to come to conclusions as a group. We sought to mine the riches of the material as a community, assuming that together we would see far more than any individual could.<br><br>Before I was even sure where I stood in my own faith, I was asked to lead a group and was provided with a set of Bible studies entitled <i>Conversations with Jesus Christ from the Gospel of John </i>by Marilyn Kunz and Catherine Schell. It cov�ered thirteen passages in the book of John where Jesus had conversations with individuals. Those studies helped my group uncover layers of meaning and insight that astonished us all. Moving through these accounts of Jesus&#x2019; life, I began to sense more than ever before that the Bible was not an or�dinary book. Yes, it carried the strange beauty of literature from the remote past; but there was something else. It was through these studies of encounters with Jesus that I began to sense an inexplicable life and power in the text. These conversations from centuries ago were uncannily relevant and incisive <i>to me&#x2014;�right now</i>. I began to search the Scriptures not just for intellectual stimulation but in order to find God.<br><br>I was taught that patience and thoughtfulness were keys to insight. At one point I went to a conference for Bible study leaders. I&#x2019;ll never forget one of the exercises. The instructor gave us one verse, Mark 1:17 (ESV): &#x201c;And Jesus said to them, &#x2018;Follow me, and I will make you become fishers of men.&#x2019; &#x201d; She asked us to spend thirty minutes studying the verse (which, naturally, was taken from an encounter with Jesus). She warned us that after five or ten minutes we would think we had seen all there was to see, but she challenged us to keep going. &#x201c;Write down at least thirty things you see in or learn from the verse.&#x201d; Ten minutes into the exercise I was finished (or so I thought) and bored. But I dutifully pushed on and kept look�ing. To my surprise there was more. When we all returned she asked us to look at our list and circle the most penetrating, moving, and personally helpful insight. Then she asked us a question: &#x201c;How many of you discovered your best insight in the first five minutes? Raise your hands.&#x201d; No hands. &#x201c;How many after ten minutes?&#x201d; One or two hands. &#x201c;Fifteen?&#x201d; More. &#x201c;Twenty?&#x201d; A large number now raised their hands. &#x201c;Twenty-�five?&#x201d; Many of us now raised our hands, smiling and shaking our heads.<br><br>Those initial experiences with patient, inductive study of the Biblical text changed my spiritual life. I discovered that if I spent the time and assumed the proper attitude of openness and trust, God spoke to me through his Word. They also set me on my vocational course by giving me the tools to help other people hear God&#x2019;s Word through the Bible. For nearly forty years I&#x2019;ve been teaching and preaching the Bible for peo�ple, but the basis for every talk, lecture, or sermon has always been what I learned in college about how to sit with a text and carefully plumb its depths.<br><br>I still accept the authority of all of the Bible, and love learn�ing and teaching from all of it. But I first felt the personal weight of the Bible&#x2019;s spiritual authority in the Gospels, partic�ularly in those conversations Jesus had with individuals&#x2014;�the skeptical student Nathanael, Jesus&#x2019; bewildered mother at the wedding feast, the religion professor who came at night, the woman at the well, the bereaved sisters Mary and Martha, and many others.<br><br>I suppose you could say that many of my own formative encounters with Jesus came from studying his encounters with individuals in the Gospels.<br><br>Several years ago, I wrote a book called <i>The Reason for God: Belief in an Age of Skepticism</i>. As a pastor in New York City for many years, I&#x2019;ve always appreciated skeptics&#x2019; argu�ments and the invaluable role they play in defining and clari�fying what is unique about Christianity. It bothers me when Christians dismiss these questions glibly or condescendingly. I remember very clearly the doubts and questions I brought to those Bible study groups back in college and how grateful I was to have them taken seriously. I&#x2019;ve seen that taking the time and effort to answer hard questions gives believers the opportunity to deepen their own faith while creating the pos�sibility that doubtful people may become open to the joy of Christianity.<br><br>So I was delighted to be asked to speak for five nights to students&#x2014;�most of them skeptics&#x2014;�in Oxford Town Hall in Oxford, England, in 2012. We agreed that I would explore encounters that individuals had with Jesus Christ in the Gospel of John. I felt this was a good choice for the setting because the accounts of these encounters reveal the core teachings and personality of Jesus in a particularly compelling way, as I had discovered personally so many years before. As I prepared to give the talks, it struck me that these encounters were apropos for another reason. In many of them we see Jesus addressing the big, universal, &#x201c;meaning of life&#x201d; questions: What is the world for? What&#x2019;s wrong with it? What (if anything) can make it right, and how? How can we be a part of making it right? And where should we look for answers to these questions in the first place? These were the big questions that everyone must ask&#x2014;�and that honest skeptics are particularly keen to explore.<br><br>Everyone has a working theory about the answers to these questions. If you try to live without them, you will soon be overwhelmed by how meaningless life seems. We live at a time when some insist that we don&#x2019;t need any such answers, that we should admit that life is just meaningless busywork in the grand scheme of the universe and leave it at that. While you are alive, they say, just try to enjoy yourself as much as you can, and when you are dead, you won&#x2019;t be around to worry about it. So why bother trying to find the meaning of life?<br><br>However, the French philosopher Luc Ferry (who, by the way, is in no way a Christian himself), in his book <i>A Brief His�tory of Thought, </i>says that such statements are &#x201c;too brutal to be honest.&#x201d; He means that people who make them cannot really believe them all the way down in their hearts. People cannot live without any hope or meaning or without a conviction that some things are more worth doing with our lives than others. And so we know we <i>do </i>have to have answers to these big ques�tions in order, as Ferry puts it, &#x201c;to live well and therefore freely, capable of joy, generosity, and love.&#x201d;<br><br>Ferry goes on to argue that almost all our possible answers to those big philosophical issues come from five or six major systems of thought. And today so many of the most common answers come from one system in particular. For example: Do you think it&#x2019;s generally a good idea to be kind to your enemies and reach out to them rather than kill them? Ferry says this idea&#x2014;�that you should love your enemies&#x2014;�came from Christi�anity and nowhere else. And as we will see, there are plenty of other ideas we would consider valid, or noble, or even beauti�ful, that came solely from Christianity.<br><br>Therefore, if you want to be sure that you are developing sound, thoughtful answers to the fundamental questions, you need at the very least to become acquainted with the teachings of Christianity. The best way to do that is to see how Jesus explained himself and his purposes to people he met&#x2014;�and how their lives were changed by his answers to their questions. That was the premise of the Oxford talks, which became the basis for the first five chapters of this book.<br><br>Yet I had to continue on, because once you have studied these accounts of life-�changing encounters with Jesus in the flesh, and have seen the beauty of his character and his pur�pose, and have heard his answers to the big questions, you are still left with another question: How can <i>I</i> encounter Jesus all these centuries later? Can I be changed just as these eyewit�nesses were changed?<br><br>The Christian gospel says that we are saved&#x2014;�changed forever&#x2014;�not by what we do, and not even by what Jesus says to people he meets, but by what he has done for us. And so we can best discover the life-�changing grace and power of Jesus if we look at what he has accomplished in the main events of his life: his birth, his sufferings in the wilderness and the garden of Gethsemane, his last hours with the disciples, his death on the cross, and his resurrection and ascension. It is through his ac�tions in these moments that Jesus accomplishes a salvation in our place that we could never have achieved ourselves. Seeing this can move you from an acquaintance with Jesus as a teacher and historical figure to a life-�changing encounter with him as redeemer and savior.<br><br>So the second half of the book will look at some of these pivotal events in Jesus&#x2019; life. The basis for these chapters was a series of talks I gave at the Harvard Club of New York City, where I spoke at regular breakfast meetings to business, gov�ernment, and cultural leaders over a period of several years. As with the Oxford talks, many of those in the room were highly educated and accomplished people who helpfully shared their own doubts and questions with me. And in both sets of talks, I was going back&#x2014;�as I have again and again through the de�cades&#x2014;�to these Gospel texts where I first felt the &#x201c;alive and active&#x201d; character of the Scriptures (Hebrews 4:12). Just as my instructor had taught me, every time I discovered more and more within them, and every time I was more excited to share what I had learned.<br><br>There is one more reason I wanted to write this book. When my granddaughter Lucy was eighteen months old, it was clear that she could perceive far more than she could ex�press. She would point at something or pick up something and then stare at me in deep frustration. She wanted to communi�cate something, but she was too young to do it. All people feel this kind of frustration at various points throughout their lives. You experience something profound and then you come down off the mountaintop or out of the concert hall or wherever you were and you try to convey it to somebody else. But your words can&#x2019;t begin to do it justice.<br><br>Certainly all Christians will feel like that when they want to describe their experiences of God. As a teacher and preacher, it is my job and greatest desire to help other people see the sheer beauty of who Christ is and what he has done. But the inadequacy of my words (or perhaps any words) to fully con�vey this beauty is a constant frustration and grief to me. Yet there is no place in the world that helps us more in this difficult project than these accounts of Jesus&#x2019; encounters with people in the Gospels.<br><br>I hope that whether you are looking at these accounts for the first time or the hundredth, you will be struck again by the person of Christ and what he has done for us.</p><h2>My Mouth is a Volcano Activity and Idea Book</h2><p><p>Teach children how to manage their thoughts and words without interrupting.</p> <p>The perfect companion to the <em>My Mouth Is A Volcano!</em> picture book.</p> <p>This supplementary teacher's guide will further help you <strong>teach your students how to manage their rambunctious thoughts and words</strong>.

In his first book, Dungan shares his advice and insight for creating these &#x201c;forever&#x201d; houses and explores eight houses in full, from a beach house on the Gulf Coast to a farmhouse in the Southern countryside to a family home in the Blue Ridge Mountains. All speak of authenticity, timelessness, and lived history that reveals itself through the rich patinas and natural textures that come with age. Layered in between are thematic essays and imagery celebrating the importance of elements such as light, stone, and rooflines in creating a home.</p><p>Acclaimed Southern architect <b>Jeffrey Dungan</b> grew up on a small Alabama farm. He has been honored with awards from the American Institute of Architects as well as the 2017 Southeast Architect of the Year Award by <i>Veranda</i> magazine and ADAC.

She hears a version of the same plea from every client in nearly every sector around the world: "I know that complexity and uncertainty are testing my instincts, but I don't know which to trust. Is there some way to know what to do when I can't know what's next?"</p> <p>Her newest work is an answer to this plea. Using her background in adult development, complexity theories, and leadership consultancy, Garvey Berger discerns five pernicious and pervasive "mind traps" to frame the book. These are: the desire for simple stories, our sense that we are right, our desire to get along with others in our group, our fixation with control, and our constant quest to protect and defend our egos. In addition to understanding why these natural impulses steer us wrong in a fast-moving world, leaders will get powerful questions and approaches that help them escape these patterns.</p></p><p><b>Jennifer Garvey Berger</b> believes that leadership is one of the most vital renewable resources in the world. At a time when organizations are often forging the path rather than following the path of others, leadership is about creating the conditions for people to be their most creative, connected, intelligent selves. She is a founding partner and CEO of Cultivating Leadership, a consultancy that serves executives and executive teams in the private, non-profit, and government sectors around the world. Her clients include Google, Microsoft, Novartis, Wikipedia, and Oxfam International. Jennifer designs and teaches leadership programs, coaches senior teams, and supports new ways of thinking about strategy and people with clients facing these dramatic shifts in complexity, volatility, and change in their workplaces and markets.

Jennifer holds a doctorate in adult development from Harvard University, where she studied under and worked with acclaimed developmental psychologist Robert Kegan. She was an Associate Professor at George Mason University before she left the academy on a mission to connect powerful research and the people doing real work in the world."In this book, Jennifer explains key skills: listening to learn, disagreeing to expand, resolution to deepen relationships.

Golf enthusiast Mike Keiser had the dream of building this British-style "links" course on a stretch of Oregon's rugged coast, and <i>Dream Golf</i> is the first all-inclusive account of how he turned his passion into a reality. <br><br>Now, in this updated and expanded edition, golf writer Stephen Goodwin revisits Bandon Dunes and introduces readers to Keiser's latest effort there, a new course named Old Macdonald that will present golfers with a more rugged, untamed version of the game. This "new" approach to the sport is, in fact, a return to the game's origins, with a very deep bow to Charles Blair Macdonald (1856 &#x2013;1939), the father of American golf course architecture and one of the founders of the U.S. Golf Association. This highly anticipated fourth course, designed by renowned golf course architect Tom Doak along with Jim Urbina &#x2015; as detailed in <i>Dream Golf</i> &#x2015; will further enhance Bandon Dunes' reputation as a place where golf really does seem to capture the ancient magic of the game.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Mike Keiser, entrepreneur, amateur golf enthusiast, and founder of the successful company Recycled Paper Greetings, turned his unlikely dream of creating a British-style links course on Oregon&#x2019;s rugged coast into one of America&#x2019;s most extraordinary golf destinations. Working against the odds, and making decisions that seemed counterintuitive to most outsiders, Keiser surprised the skeptics and charmed the critics with the result of his efforts. When it opened in 1999, Bandon Dunes was instantly acclaimed one of the best courses in the world.<br><br> This book, written with Keiser&#x2019;s full cooperation, is the first all-inclusive account of how he translated his passion into a reality. It reveals the difficulties he had to overcome, the personalities he encountered&#x2014;most notably two of golf architecture&#x2019;s most controversial figures, Scotsman David Kidd and American Tom Doak&#x2014;and the goal he has achieved in creating a true golfing utopia in an astonishingly short period of time on a wild, windblown bluff high above the Pacific.This is the story of a man with a dream--as well as the vision and passion to make it come true. The dream was to build a great American links course, one that would contain all the excitement of the famous golfing destinations in Scotland and Ireland, storied places like St. Andrews and Ballybunion. The man was Mike Keiser, an entrepreneur and amateur golf enthusiast, founder of the successful company Recycled Paper Greetings, and "Dream Golf" is the story of how, with the help of some of the most colorful--and occasionally controversial--men in golf, he transformed a remote area on Oregon's Pacific coast into not one, but three of the most stunning, challenging, and highly ranked courses in the world.<br> It began modestly, when Mike Keiser decided to build a nine-hole "dunes" course and golf club on the shore of Lake Michigan, near his home in Chicago. The experience prompted him to look further, with the goal of realizing a dream that he had harbored for some time: to bring to American golfers the same kind of experience he had enjoyed while playing some of the legendary courses of the British Isles, "links" courses that had evolved naturally to fit the rugged, heaving coastal terrain. These ancient courses were the antithesis of most modern American courses, where the features were shaped by bulldozers and all too often look sleek, manicured, and artificial. <br> No, Bandon Dunes would be a "pure" golf experience, pitting the golfer against the elements, allowing the land to dictate the course, banning the use of carts, making the golfer feel at one with both nature and the game. To achieve that goal would take a great amount of planning and hard work, the struggle of man againstnature in shaping the land into three courses that would become the Bandon Dunes complex. Conventional wisdom said it was impossible. And even if he built it, would anyone come to this remote Oregon outpost?<br> "Dream Golf" is the first complete account of how drive and determination, coupled with the best minds in the game, created a utopian golf experience in a place of breathtaking natural beauty. It is the gripping and compelling account of how one man followed his dream to its greatest conclusion.</p><h2>The Great Blue Hills of God: A Story of Facing Loss, Finding Peace, and Learning the True Meaning of Home</h2><p><b>The creative force behind Blackberry Farm, Tennessee&#x2019;s award-winning farm-to- table resort, reveals how she found herself only after losing everything in this powerful memoir of resilience.&nbsp;</b><br>&nbsp;<br>Born with the gift of hospitality, Kreis Beall helped create one of the nation&#x2019;s most renowned resort destinations, Blackberry Farm, in Tennessee&#x2019;s Smoky Mountain foothills. For decades, she was a fixture in the travel and entertaining world and frequently appeared in the pages of popular home and design magazines.

After spending years on her beautiful exterior life and work, she begins the hardest undertaking of all: reclaiming and redesigning her interior life and soul.<br>&nbsp;<br>Kreis retreats to Blackberry Farm, moving into an unassuming, 300-square-foot shed with peeling paint on the exterior walls, &#x201c;where I met myself for the first time.&#x201d; She examines what it takes to redefine life after deep loss and acknowledges, for the first time, often unbearable truths that existed beneath the beauty she had created.<br>&nbsp;<br>By turns fiercely honest, heartbreaking, and warm, Kreis Beall&#x2019;s story will resonate with anyone who can benefit from her discovery that &#x201c;All it takes is all you&#x2019;ve got.

She will become your new cheerleader." - Casey Wilson<br><br>"This book destroyed me. But not in a 'It made me so depressed!' kind of way. It destroyed me because it was just so deeply relatable. It made me remember my own mother, and made me wish I had met Kate's. I spent the entire book not only laughing and crying, but just so pissed Kate's mom couldn't read it herself. She would be so proud.

Her accent was thick, her attitude disappointed.<br> <br>Simon Lewis couldn&#x2019;t blame her; she&#x2019;d probably been hoping for a better tip than the one she was going to get on a single cup of coffee. But it wasn&#x2019;t his fault vampires didn&#x2019;t eat. Sometimes, in restaurants, he ordered food anyway, just to preserve the appearance of normalcy, but late Tuesday night, when Veselka was almost empty of other customers, it didn&#x2019;t seem worth the bother. &#x201c;Just the coffee.&#x201d;<br> <br>With a shrug the waitress took his laminated menu and went to put his order in. Simon sat back against the hard plastic diner chair and looked around. Veselka, a diner on the corner of Ninth Street and Second Avenue, was one of his favorite places on the Lower East Side&#x2014;an old neighborhood eatery papered with black-and-white murals, where they let you sit all day as long as you ordered coffee at half-hour intervals. They also served what had once been his favorite vegetarian pierogi and borscht, but those days were behind him now.<br> <br>It was mid-October, and they&#x2019;d just put their Halloween decorations up&#x2014;a wobbly sign that said TRICK-OR-BORSCHT! and a fake cardboard cutout vampire nicknamed Count Blintzula. Once upon a time Simon and Clary had found the cheesy holiday decorations hilarious, but the Count, with his fake fangs and black cape, didn&#x2019;t strike Simon as quite so funny anymore.<br> <br>Simon glanced toward the window. It was a brisk night, and the wind was blowing leaves across Second Avenue like handfuls of thrown confetti. There was a girl walking down the street, a girl in a tight belted trench coat, with long black hair that flew in the wind. People turned to watch her as she walked past. Simon had looked at girls like that before in the past, idly wondering where they were going, who they were meeting. Not guys like him, he knew that much.<br> <br>Except this one was. The bell on the diner&#x2019;s front door rang as the door opened, and Isabelle Lightwood came in. She smiled when she saw Simon, and came toward him, shrugging off her coat and draping it over the back of the chair before she sat down. Under the coat she was wearing one of what Clary called her &#x201c;typical Isabelle outfits&#x201d;: a tight short velvet dress, fishnet stockings, and boots. There was a knife stuck into the top of her left boot that Simon knew only he could see; still, everyone in the diner was watching as she sat down, flinging her hair back. Whatever she was wearing, Isabelle drew attention like a fireworks display.<br> <br>Beautiful Isabelle Lightwood. When Simon had met her, he&#x2019;d assumed she&#x2019;d have no time for a guy like him. He&#x2019;d turned out to be mostly right. Isabelle liked boys her parents disapproved of, and in her universe that meant Downworlders&#x2014;faeries, werewolves, and vamps. That they&#x2019;d been dating regularly for the past month or two amazed him, even if their relationship was limited mostly to infrequent meetings like this one. And even if he couldn&#x2019;t help but wonder if he&#x2019;d never been changed into a vampire, if his whole life hadn&#x2019;t been altered in that moment, would they be dating at all?<br> <br>She tucked a lock of hair behind her ear, her smile brilliant. &#x201c;You look nice.&#x201d;<br> <br>Simon cast a glance at himself in the reflective surface of the diner window. Isabelle&#x2019;s influence was clear in the changes in his appearance since they&#x2019;d been dating. She&#x2019;d forced him to ditch his hoodies in favor of leather jackets, and his sneakers in favor of designer boots. Which, incidentally, cost three hundred dollars a pair. He was still wearing his characteristic word shirts&#x2014;this one said EXISTENTIALISTS DO IT POINTLESSLY&#x2014;but his jeans no longer had holes in the knees and torn pockets. He&#x2019;d also grown his hair long so that it fell in his eyes now, covering his forehead, but that was more necessity than Isabelle.<br> <br>Clary made fun of him about his new look; but, then, Clary found everything about Simon&#x2019;s love life borderline hilarious. She couldn&#x2019;t believe he was dating Isabelle in any serious way. Of course, she also couldn&#x2019;t believe he was also dating Maia Roberts, a friend of theirs who happened to be a werewolf, in an equally serious way. And she really couldn&#x2019;t believe that Simon hadn&#x2019;t yet told either of them about the other.<br> <br>Simon wasn&#x2019;t really sure how it had happened. Maia liked to come to his house and use his Xbox&#x2014;they didn&#x2019;t have one at the abandoned police station where the werewolf pack lived&#x2014;and it wasn&#x2019;t until the third or fourth time she&#x2019;d come over that she&#x2019;d leaned over and kissed him good-bye before she&#x2019;d left. He&#x2019;d been pleased, and then had called up Clary to ask her if he needed to tell Isabelle. &#x201c;Figure out what&#x2019;s going on with you and Isabelle,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Then tell her.&#x201d;<br> <br>This had turned out to be bad advice. It had been a month, and he still wasn&#x2019;t sure what was going on with him and Isabelle, so he hadn&#x2019;t said anything. And the more time that passed, the more awkward the idea of saying something grew. So far he&#x2019;d made it work. Isabelle and Maia weren&#x2019;t really friends, and rarely saw each other. Unfortunately for him, that was about to change. Clary&#x2019;s mother and her longtime friend, Luke, were getting married in a few weeks, and both Isabelle and Maia were invited to the wedding, a prospect Simon found more terrifying than the idea of being chased through the streets of New York by an angry mob of vampire hunters.<br> <br>&#x201c;So,&#x201d; Isabelle said, snapping him out of his reverie. &#x201c;Why here and not Taki&#x2019;s? They&#x2019;d serve you blood there.&#x201d;<br> <br>Simon winced at her volume. Isabelle was nothing if not unsubtle. Fortunately, no one seemed to be listening in, not even the waitress who returned, banged down a cup of coffee in front of Simon, eyed Izzy, and left without taking her order.<br> <br>&#x201c;I like it here,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Clary and I used to come here back when she was taking classes at Tisch. They have great borscht and blintzes&#x2014;they&#x2019;re like sweet cheese dumplings&#x2014;plus it&#x2019;s open all night.&#x201d;<br> <br>Isabelle, however, was ignoring him. She was staring past his shoulder. &#x201c;What is that?&#x201d;<br> <br>Simon followed her glance. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s Count Blintzula.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Count Blintzula?&#x201d;<br> <br>Simon shrugged. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a Halloween decoration. Count Blintzula is for kids. It&#x2019;s like Count Chocula, or the Count on Sesame Street.&#x201d; He grinned at her blank look. &#x201c;You know. He teaches kids how to count.&#x201d;<br> <br>Isabelle was shaking her head. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a TV show where children are taught how to count by a vampire?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It would make sense if you&#x2019;d seen it,&#x201d; Simon muttered.<br> <br>&#x201c;There is some mythological basis for such a construction,&#x201d; Isabelle said, lapsing into lecturey Shadowhunter mode. &#x201c;Some legends do assert that vampires are obsessed with counting, and that if you spill grains of rice in front of them, they&#x2019;ll have to stop what they&#x2019;re doing and count each one. There&#x2019;s no truth in it, of course, any more than that business about garlic. And vampires have no business teaching children. Vampires are terrifying.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; Simon said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a joke, Isabelle. He&#x2019;s the Count. He likes counting. You know. &#x2018;What did the Count eat today, children? One chocolate chip cookie, two chocolate chip cookies, three chocolate chip cookies . . .&#x2019;&#x201d;<br> <br>There was a rush of cold air as the door of the restaurant opened, letting in another customer. Isabelle shivered and reached for her black silk scarf. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not realistic.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What would you prefer? &#x2018;What did the Count eat today, children? One helpless villager, two helpless villagers, three helpless villagers . . .&#x2019;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Shh.&#x201d; Isabelle finished knotting her scarf around her throat and leaned forward, putting her hand on Simon&#x2019;s wrist. Her big dark eyes were alive suddenly, the way they only ever came alive when she was either hunting demons or thinking about hunting demons. &#x201c;Look over there.&#x201d;<br> <br>Simon followed her gaze. There were two men standing over by the glass-fronted case that held bakery items: thickly frosted cakes, plates of rugelach, and cream-filled Danishes. Neither of the men looked as if they were interested in food, though. Both were short and painfully gaunt, so much so that their cheekbones jutted from their colorless faces like knives. Both had thin gray hair and pale gray eyes, and wore belted slate-colored coats that reached the floor.<br> <br>&#x201c;Now,&#x201d; Isabelle said, &#x201c;what do you suppose they are?&#x201d;<br> <br>Simon squinted at them. They both stared back at him, their lashless eyes like empty holes. &#x201c;They kind of look like evil lawn gnomes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re human subjugates,&#x201d; Isabelle hissed. &#x201c;They belong to a vampire.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;&#x2018;Belong&#x2019; as in . . .?&#x201d;<br> <br>She made an impatient noise. &#x201c;By the Angel, you don&#x2019;t know anything about your kind, do you? Do you even really know how vampires are made?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, when a mommy vampire and a daddy vampire love each other very much . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>Isabelle made a face at him. &#x201c;Fine, you know that vampires don&#x2019;t need to have sex to reproduce, but I bet you don&#x2019;t really know how it works.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I do too,&#x201d; said Simon. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a vampire because I drank some of Raphael&#x2019;s blood before I died. Drinking blood plus death equals vampire.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not exactly,&#x201d; said Isabelle. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a vampire because you drank some of Raphael&#x2019;s blood, and then you were bitten by other vampires, and then you died. You need to be bitten at some point during the process.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Vampire saliva has . . . properties. Transformative properties.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yech,&#x201d; said Simon.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t &#x2018;yech&#x2019; me. You&#x2019;re the one with the magical spit. Vampires keep humans around and feed on them when they&#x2019;re short on blood&#x2014;like walking snack machines.&#x201d; Izzy spoke with distaste. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d think they&#x2019;d be weak from blood loss all the time, but vampire saliva actually has healing properties. It increases their red blood cell count, makes them stronger and healthier, and makes them live longer. That&#x2019;s why it&#x2019;s not against the Law for a vampire to feed on a human. It doesn&#x2019;t really hurt them. Of course every once in a while the vampire will decide it wants more than a snack, it wants a subjugate&#x2014;and then it will start feeding its bitten human small amounts of vampire blood, just to keep it docile, to keep it connected to its master. Subjugates worship their masters, and love serving them. All they want is to be near them. Like you were when you went back to the Dumont. You were drawn back to the vampire whose blood you had consumed.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Raphael,&#x201d; Simon said, his voice bleak. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t feel a burning urge to be with him these days, let me tell you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, it goes away when you become a full vampire. It&#x2019;s only the subjugates who worship their sires and can&#x2019;t disobey them. Don&#x2019;t you see? When you went back to the Dumont, Raphael&#x2019;s clan drained you, and you died, and then you became a vampire. But if they hadn&#x2019;t drained you, if they&#x2019;d given you more vampire blood instead, you would eventually have become a subjugate.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s all very interesting,&#x201d; Simon said. &#x201c;But it doesn&#x2019;t explain why they&#x2019;re staring at us.&#x201d;<br> <br>Isabelle glanced back at them. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re staring at you. Maybe their master died and they&#x2019;re looking for another vampire to own them. You could have pets.&#x201d; She grinned.<br> <br>&#x201c;Or,&#x201d; Simon said, &#x201c;maybe they&#x2019;re here for the hash browns.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Human subjugates don&#x2019;t eat food. They live on a mix of vampire blood and animal blood. It keeps them in a state of suspended animation. They&#x2019;re not immortal, but they age very slowly.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sadly,&#x201d; Simon said, eyeing them, &#x201c;they don&#x2019;t seem to keep their looks.&#x201d;<br> <br>Isabelle sat up straight. &#x201c;And they&#x2019;re on their way over here. I guess we&#x2019;ll find out what they want.&#x201d;<br> <br>The human subjugates moved as if they were on wheels. They didn&#x2019;t appear to be taking steps so much as gliding forward soundlessly. It took them only seconds to cross the restaurant; by the time they neared Simon&#x2019;s table, Isabelle had whipped the sharp stiletto-like dagger out of the top of her boot. It lay across the table, gleaming in the diner&#x2019;s fluorescent lights. It was a dark, heavy silver, with crosses burned into both sides of the hilt. Most vampire-repelling weapons seemed to sport crosses, on the assumption, Simon thought, that most vampires were Christian. Who knew that following a minority religion could be so advantageous?<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s close enough,&#x201d; Isabelle said, as the two subjugates paused beside the table, her fingers inches from the dagger. &#x201c;State your business, you two.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Shadowhunter.&#x201d; The creature on the left spoke in a hissing whisper. &#x201c;We did not know of you in this situation.&#x201d;<br> <br>Isabelle raised a delicate eyebrow. &#x201c;And what situation would that be?&#x201d;<br> <br>The second subjugate pointed a long gray finger at Simon. The nail on the end of it was yellowed and sharp. &#x201c;We have dealings with the Daylighter.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, you don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Simon said. &#x201c;I have no idea who you are. Never seen you before.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I am Mr. Walker,&#x201d; said the first creature. &#x201c;Beside me is Mr. Archer. We serve the most powerful vampire in New York City. The head of the greatest Manhattan clan.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Raphael Santiago,&#x201d; said Isabelle. &#x201c;In that case you must know that Simon isn&#x2019;t a part of any clan. He&#x2019;s a free agent.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mr. Walker smiled a thin smile. &#x201c;My master was hoping that was a situation that could be altered.&#x201d;<br> <br>Simon met Isabelle&#x2019;s eyes across the table. She shrugged. &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t Raphael tell you he wanted you to stay away from the clan?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe he&#x2019;s changed his mind,&#x201d; Simon suggested. &#x201c;You know how he is. Moody. Fickle.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t know. I haven&#x2019;t really seen him since that time I threatened to kill him with a candelabra. He took it well, though. Didn&#x2019;t flinch.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Fantastic,&#x201d; Simon said. The two subjugates were staring at him. Their eyes were a pale whitish gray color, like dirty snow. &#x201c;If Raphael wants me in the clan, it&#x2019;s because he wants something from me. You might as well tell me what it is.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We are not privy to our master&#x2019;s plans,&#x201d; said Mr. Archer in a haughty tone.<br> <br>&#x201c;No dice, then,&#x201d; said Simon. &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t go.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If you do not wish to come with us, we are authorized to use force to bring you.&#x201d;<br> <br>The dagger seemed to leap into Isabelle&#x2019;s hand; or at least, she barely seemed to move, and yet she was holding it. She twirled it lightly. &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t do that if I were you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mr. Archer bared his teeth at her. &#x201c;Since when have the Angel&#x2019;s children become the bodyguards for rogue Downworlders? I would have thought you above this sort of business, Isabelle Lightwood.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not his bodyguard,&#x201d; said Isabelle. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m his girlfriend. Which gives me the right to kick your ass if you bother him. That&#x2019;s how it works.&#x201d;<br> <br>Girlfriend? Simon was startled enough to look at her in surprise, but she was staring down the two subjugates, her dark eyes flashing. On the one hand he didn&#x2019;t think Isabelle had ever referred to herself as his girlfriend before. On the other hand it was symptomatic of how strange his life had become that that was the thing that had startled him most tonight, rather than the fact that he had just been summoned to a meeting by the most powerful vampire in New York.<br> <br>&#x201c;My master,&#x201d; said Mr. Walker, in what he probably thought was a soothing tone, &#x201c;has a proposition to put to the Daylighter&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;His name is Simon. Simon Lewis.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;To put to Mr. Lewis. I can promise you that Mr. Lewis will find it most advantageous if he is willing to accompany us and hear my master out. I swear on my master&#x2019;s honor that no harm will come to you, Daylighter, and that should y...</p><h2>Animals Should Definitely Not Wear Clothing</h2><p><b>Animals should definitely not wear clothing.</b> <br> ...because a snake would lose it, a billy goat would eat it for lunch, and it would always be wet on a walrus!

Metcalf and Thomas R. Metcalf, has become a classic in the field since it was first published in 2001. As a fresh interpretation of Indian history from the Mughals to the present, it has informed students across the world. In the third edition of the book, a final chapter charts the dramatic developments of the last twenty years, from 1990 through the Congress electoral victory of 2009, to the rise of the Indian high-tech industry in a country still troubled by poverty and political unrest. The narrative focuses on the fundamentally political theme of the imaginative and institutional structures that have successively sustained and transformed India, first under British colonial rule and then, after 1947, as an independent country. Woven into the larger political narrative is an account of India&#39;s social and economic development, and its rich cultural life. Throughout, the authors argue that despite a powerful historiographical tradition to the contrary, no enduring meaning can be given to categories such as &#39;caste&#39;, &#39;Hindu&#39;, &#39;Muslim&#39;, or even &#39;India&#39;.</p><p>The Metcalfs&#39; classic history of India has informed students across the world since publication in 2001.

Sarah Allen's six-year-old daughter, Holly, looked up at her with big blue, tear-filled eyes. "I like it here. I don't want to go."<br><br>Anxious to be on her way, Sarah reached down and lifted the little blonde girl into her arms. "Don't cry, sweetie. I promise you're going to love it. The mountains are beautiful and there are these rivers and big green forests, and you can have a puppy if you want." At least Sarah hoped so.<br><br>Surely the owners of the cottage she had rented wouldn't mind. The house was, after all, on a very large ranch, at least twelve thousand acres.<br><br>Holly sniffed back tears and looked up with interest. "A puppy? Can I really?"<br><br>"As soon as we get settled, we'll drive into town and you can adopt one from the pound." Sarah glanced nervously toward the door. The car was packed, the rest of their personal possessions boxed and shipped. She was leaving Los Angeles and she prayed she was leaving her troubles, as well.<br><br>The sooner they left town, the safer she would feel.<br><br>She set Holly back on her feet, took a last glance around the expensive Santa Monica apartment she had occupied with her late husband, surveyed the plush white carpet and chic black lacquer furniture that was Andrew's taste, not hers. There was nothing homey, nothing the least bit geared toward a family. The condo was just for show&#x2014;no substance beyond the surface beauty. Just like Andrew.<br><br>Sarah started for the door, but the phone rang before she could reach it. She considered just letting it ring, a hollow echo now that her things were gone, but she was afraid it might be important.<br><br>She lifted the receiver and pressed it against her ear.<br><br>"Hello."<br><br>"Sarah, this is Martin Kozak." His raspy smoker's voice grated over the line. "We need to talk."<br><br>A shiver went down her spine. Marty Kozak was one of Andrew's business associates. A few weeks ago, Marty had started calling, trying to set up a meeting. Sarah didn't want to talk to him or any of Andrew's other shady business acquaintances.<br><br>"What do you want, Marty? I told you I don't know anything about Andrew's affairs. He never talked to me about business. We never discussed it."<br><br><em>He didn't think I was smart enough, or savvy enough about finances, or he just plain didn't want to.</em><br><br>And Andrew never did anything he didn't want to do.<br><br>"Like I told you before," Marty said, "Andrew had something important I need. Did you find anything in his personal belongings? A list he might have been keeping? A computer disk, maybe, or a record book of some kind?"<br><br>"No. Before he died, we were barely speaking." That was an understatement. When they were together, Andrew did all the talking, mostly about himself. Sarah had been trying to leave him for years, but she had been afraid of what would happen if she did. "He didn't tell me anything, and he didn't give me anything."<br><br>"Maybe there was something in his personal effects."<br><br>"Not that I know of."<br><br>"I'd like to talk to you, Sarah."<br><br>"I'm sorry, Marty. I was just walking out the door. I've really got to go." By the time she hung up the phone, she was shaking. She had no idea what sort of trouble Andrew might have been in before he was killed, but she wasn't part of it and never had been.<br><br><em>Once you get out of town, </em>she told herself, <em>everything is going to be all right.</em><br><br>Things were bound to settle down. After her husband's murder, the police had questioned her extensively, but that had been months ago and they were certain his death was a result of his gambling debts or crooked business dealings. She figured Marty had waited for the police investigation to die down before he began to press her for whatever it was he wanted.<br><br>Sarah closed her eyes and dragged in a steadying breath. The past would fade, she told herself, and in time, even Andrew's associates would leave her alone.<br><br>Grabbing Holly's hand and the big leather purse that carried everything from bandages to emergency food&#x2014;breakfast bars this morning&#x2014;she took the private elevator down to the underground garage where her Mercedes, one of the few possessions Andrew had actually put in her name, was parked.<br><br>Everything else belonged solely to him and he managed to keep it that way with the prenuptial agreement she had signed. After he died, she was only mildly surprised to discover he owed more money than he had in his bank accounts and had mortgaged or sold all of the real estate he owned. He had even let his life insurance policy expire.<br><br>Sarah had been left with nothing. She had sold everything she could to raise enough money to move out of L.A., taken back her maiden name, changed Holly's name, and found a job over the internet in her home town of Wind Canyon, Wyoming. On a site for rental properties, she had happened upon a cottage on a ranch in the country not too far from town.<br><br>All she had to do was get there.<br><br>Still clutching Holly's hand, Sarah opened the rear car door, set her daughter in the booster seat and strapped her in, then rounded the vehicle and slid behind the wheel. It was a thousand-mile journey to Wyoming.<br><br>Sarah thought of Andrew, his extravagant lifestyle, his gambling and the crooked deals he made to keep the money rolling in. She thought of Marty Kozak and the rest of Andrew's so-called business associates.<br><br>She wouldn't feel safe until she got there.<br><br>Jackson Raines tightened his hold on the steering wheel of his white Ford extended-cab pickup. The temperature outside was two below, the wind howling, the heavy snow blowing sideways. A Wyoming blizzard was nothing to sneeze at, even one this late in spring. Keeping his eyes carefully fixed on the road, he was surprised to see a pair of taillights up ahead, barely visible through the blowing snow, twin dots of red flashing in hazard mode, the car pulled off on the side of the road.<br><br>Jackson started slowing way before he reached the vehicle. He didn't want to slide into the damned thing, and on a road as icy as this one, it wouldn't be hard to do.<br><br>There was rarely any traffic on the narrow two lanes that led nowhere except to a couple of ranches in the area. He couldn't help wondering who would be driving out here in this kind of weather. Hell, he wouldn't be here himself if he hadn't been in town when the storm blew in, several hours earlier than expected. He should have known. In mountains like these, the weatherman was never right.<br><br>He slowed even more, downshifted until the pickup was moving at a crawl, then pulled in behind the stranded auto. California license plates. Through the blinding wall of white, he recognized the car as a newer Mercedes. <em>500S </em>gleamed in chrome on the left side of the trunk.<br><br>Jackson pulled on a pair of leather work gloves and climbed out of the pickup. He should have figured it would be some rich guy with more money than common sense.<br><br>Tugging his worn cowboy hat down over his forehead, he walked up to the car and rapped on the window. The driver flinched at the sound as if he'd been shot. He pressed the button and the window eased down, and Jackson frowned as he realized the driver was a woman. And in her lap, she was holding a little girl.<br><br>"Thank God you stopped," the woman said, her teeth chattering.<br><br>"What in blazes are you doing out here?"<br><br>"I thought we could get where we were going before the storm came in."<br><br>He could hardly argue with that since he had done the same thing.<br><br>"What's the problem?"<br><br>"Flat tire. My cell phone's out of range. I thought about trying to make it on the rim, but I was afraid I wouldn't get there and just ruin the wheel, then no one would be able to put on the spare."<br><br>He nodded. "You did the right thing."<br><br>"Can you help us?"<br><br>There was something familiar about the woman's voice. He leaned down, trying to get a better look at her, but she was wearing a fancy fur coat and she had the collar pulled up over her ears, hiding most of her face. "Open the trunk."<br><br>She pressed a button somewhere inside the car and the trunk popped open.<br><br>"Should I get out and help?" she asked.<br><br>His eyebrows went up. He hadn't expected her to be the type to put herself out, especially not in the middle of a snowstorm.<br><br>"Nothing much you can do." He looked at the little girl, blond hair and big blue eyes, and he could see she was frightened. "I'll do what I can. Roll the window back up before you freeze."<br><br>Jackson pulled up the collar of his heavy down jacket and crunched through the snow toward the back of the Mercedes, silver, he saw, now mostly covered by at least an inch of fresh powder. He pulled the jack out of the trunk, walked around and stuck it under the frame. As he shoved the handle into the slot and started cranking, he thought about the woman.<br><br>He could only see enough of her to know she had thick, chestnut-brown hair about the color of her fancy mink coat and eyes as blue as her daughter's. Her skin was smooth and he thought she had a nice straight nose but he couldn't really be sure.<br><br>Still, there was something about her....<br><br>Jackson pulled off the flat tire, got the spare out from under the luggage in the trunk, eventually got it on and replaced the lug nuts. It was ball-freezing cold and he wanted to get back to the ranch before the storm got any worse. When he finished putting the jack away, he reloaded the luggage, closed the trunk and walked back to the window, which slid open with a soft electric hum.<br><br>The woman stuck out a slim hand encased in a brown kid glove holding a twenty-dollar bill. "Thank you so much. I really appreciate your help."<br><br>"Keep your money," he said, only slightly annoyed. Out here people helped each other because it was the right thing to do. "It was only a flat tire."<br><br>"Are you sure? You must be freezing. I wish I could pay you more, but&#x2014;"<br><br>"Consider it a favor. Where are you headed?"<br><br>"Just down the road." She checked the map that lay open on the console. "It's just a couple more miles."<br><br>It had to be one of the ranches up ahead. There wasn't much else out here. "I'll follow you to the turnoff."<br><br>She nodded and fired up the engine. The Mercedes didn't have four-wheel drive, but it was a good, heavy auto, and if she took her time, she could make it to where she was going. As if she were still on the freeway back in California, she put on her left turn signal and pulled cautiously onto the road.<br><br>Jackson felt the tug of a smile as she navigated the big car carefully down the lane. Again, he wondered who she was and what had brought her twenty miles from Wind Canyon, the nearest town.<br><br>Back in his pickup, he cranked the engine and followed them at a safe distance until her turn signal went on again and she made a very slow turn onto the private road leading to the Whittaker Ranch. He watched until he was sure she was close enough to the ranch to make it, then gave her a wave she probably couldn't see and drove on down the road toward home. It was only a couple miles farther. Olivia would have a pot of coffee on the stove and if he was lucky, stew and biscuits for supper.<br><br>Jackson pressed down on the gas pedal, eager to get in out of the weather.<br><br>Sarah rounded a corner and saw the sign for the Whit-taker Ranch. Biting back a swear word she couldn't say in front of Holly, she cautiously stepped on the brake.<br><br>"What's the matter, Mommy?"<br><br>"I turned too soon. This is the Whittaker Ranch. We're looking for the Raintree Ranch."<br><br>"Do we have to turn around?" Holly gazed worriedly out the window into the storm.<br><br>"We'll turn around as soon as I can find a wide enough spot in the road." She wasn't taking any chances. The next time she ran into trouble, her old classmate, Jackson Raines, wouldn't be there to help her.<br><br>Sarah released a shaky breath that turned white inside the car, even with the heater running full blast. Though he looked older, more rugged than he had when he was a senior at Wind Canyon High, she had known him instantly. She had kept her head down, hoping Jackson wouldn't recognize her, and she didn't think he had.<br><br>She knew he'd left town after high school. According to her friend, Nancy Marcus, he had gone to the University of Wyoming on a boxing scholarship. Everyone in Wind Canyon had watched the Barcelona Olympics the year Jackson had competed in the light heavyweight division, and though he hadn't won, everyone in Wyoming had been proud of the effort he had made.<br><br>Sarah had never heard any more about him.<br><br>She certainly didn't know he had returned to Wind Canyon. Maybe he was working as a hand on one of the local ranches. She remembered he had done that during the summers when he'd been in high school.<br><br>Driving carefully, she continued along the road and finally found a turnaround spot, her thoughts still on Jackson, the gangly teenager he had been and the lean, broad-shouldered, rugged-looking man he had become. With his high cheekbones, dark eyes and nearly black hair, he had been a good-looking boy. Now, at thirty-five&#x2014;three years older than she&#x2014;he was a man, with an air of confidence that made him even more attractive.<br><br>Focusing her attention on getting back to the main road, Sarah used the circular turnaround made for just that purpose. It was nice and wide and she was able to change direction without a problem, even with the building layer of snow.<br><br>She had taken Holly out of the backseat when the tire went flat so they could huddle together and stay warm. For the few miles left to their destination, the six-year-old was strapped into the passenger seat with the air bag turned off.<br><br>Sarah kept the car going slowly all the way to the entrance gate, then turned right, back onto the two-lane road. The next two miles felt like ten, with the car slipping on the ice beneath the snow and the wind making an eerie moaning sound.<br><br></p><h2>Problems</h2><p><p>Dark, raw, and very funny, <i>Problems </i>introduces us to Maya, a young woman with a smart mouth, time to kill, and a heroin hobby that isn't much fun anymore. Maya's been able to get by in New York on her wits and a dead-end bookstore job for years, but when her husband leaves her and her favorite professor ends their affair, her barely-calibrated life descends into chaos, and she has to make some choices. Maya's struggle to be alone, to be a woman, and to be thoughtful and imperfect and alive in a world that doesn't really care what happens to her is rendered with dead-eyed clarity and unnerving charm. This book takes every tired trope about addiction and recovery, "likeable" characters, and redemption narratives, and blows them to pieces.</p><p>Emily Books is a publishing project and ebook subscription service whose focus is on transgressive writers of the past, present and future, with an emphasis on the writing of women, trans and queer people, writing that blurs genre distinctions and is funny, challenging, and provocative.</p><p><b>Jade Sharma </b>is a writer living in New York.

Maya is as horrible, and as fully human, as men in literature have always been allowed to be." <strong><em>&#x2014;New York Times Sunday Book Review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Sharma&#x2019;s lucid intelligence makes this story of the death throes of a marriage between a junkie and an alcoholic impossible to get out of your mind.&#x201d; <strong><em>&#x2014;Vulture</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Debut novelist Jade Sharma writes in a voice that is equal parts irreverent and hilarious, depressive and hopeful, and Problems was by far one of the most interesting and uncommon books I read this year.&#x201d; <strong><em>&#x2014;Bustle</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;With searing honesty and an unflinching gaze, Sharma brilliantly dismantles the brittle structures that so many young women today have built around themselves in the hopes that eventually the interior will match what&#x2019;s on the outside.&#x201d; <strong><em>&#x2014;Nylon</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Sharma's debut is an uncompromising and unforgettable depiction of the corrosive loop of addiction, and with Maya, she has crafted a momentous and painfully honest voice.&#x201d;<strong><em>&#x2014;Publishers Weekly, </em>Best Books of 2016</strong><br><br>"Sharma&#x2019;s debut novel is an uncompromising and unforgettable depiction of the corrosive loop of addiction. . . . there is a propulsive energy in Maya&#x2019;s story, guided by her askew yet precise perspective . . . in Maya&#x2019;s voice, Sharma has crafted a momentous force that never flags and feels painfully honest." <strong><em>&#x2014;Publishers Weekly,</em> starred review</strong><br><br>&#x201c;The novel is written so well that the relentless and destructive rhythm of heroin abuse seems calming, metaphysical, and occasionally even funny. Sharma's descriptions are vivid and sage . . . lulling readers into a similarly opiate state to which they will readily succumb and from which, like the protagonist, it will take some time to recover. An absorbing novel carried by a seemingly hopeless protagonist you will want to befriend and save.&#x201d; <strong><em>&#x2014;Kirkus</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Sharma laces her prose with a particularly strong strain of dark humor, leaving elegant signatures on every page with the abandon of a drunk hostess who&#x2019;s been handed a blank prescription pad, granted immunity, and charged with a divine imperative to make sure everyone has a good time.&#x201d;<strong><em>&#x2014;The Rumpus</em></strong><br><br><br>&#x201c;Maya's inner world is raw and repulsive, but astutely rendered by Sharma. The book is simultaneously hard to read and hard to put down.&#x201d; <strong><em>&#x2014;Publishers Weekly</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;[Maya&#x2019;s] problems could fill a book &#x2014; and in fact, they do, in a brisk, mordantly funny, fragmented narrative that is refreshingly honest, despite the fact that Maya is a liar.&#x201d; <strong><em>&#x2014;Los Angeles Times</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;[Maya is] by turns raunchy, clever, spunky, sage, funny and forlorn as she barrels through the vicissitudes of a life of addiction grasping for an escape hatch--such a fresh voice that we can't help but hope she finds one. . . . Jade Sharma's debut novel of a young New York City junkie is on the money, harrowing, perspicacious, funny and somehow still uplifting.&#x201d; <strong><em>&#x2014;Shelf Awareness</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Problems, told in fragments of Maya&#x2019;s thoughts, avoids the clich�s of addition and recovery narratives to speak to something dark, hilarious and deeply real.&#x201d;<strong><em>&#x2014;Autostraddle</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Jade Sharma's debut is a darkly funny character study of an unhappy yet witty-as-hell woman whose self-destructive streak is as appalling as it is somehow understandable. Problems challenges readers to forget traditional redemption stories and yet to still find empathy for the messiest of heroines.&#x201d;<strong><em>&#x2014;Esquire</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Problems tells Maya&#x2019;s story of heroin abuse, personal flailing and recovery in raw, razor-sharp prose, painting an unromanticized yet witty and profound portrait of addiction.&#x201d;<strong><em>&#x2014;Huffington Post</em></strong><br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;. . . a rather tender novel in places, without being sentimental . . .&#x201d;&nbsp;<strong><em>&#x2014;Spectator</em></strong><br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Maya&#x2019;s complex blend of vulnerability and ennui is enthralling, and her abiding fascination with bodies&#x2014;sex, sensations, shortcomings--keeps her commentary lively even as her life careens out of control. Given such diversions, it&#x2019;s perhaps easy to miss the big picture: the invitation that Sharma is extending to readers to reimagine the possibilities for what a 'heroin novel' can be." <strong><em>&#x2014;Critical Mass</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The end of <em>Problems</em> presents a glimmer of hope that she may finally be able to crawl out of it and evolve into the person she wants to be.&#x201d; <strong><em>&#x2014;Star Tribune</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Raw, unrepentant, and biting with dark humor, <em>Problems</em> turns the addiction-redemption narrative inside out, as Sharma follows heroin hobbyist Maya through her increasingly chaotic life after both the end of her marriage and an affair.&#x201d; <strong><em>&#x2014;Poets and Writers</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The problem with Jade Sharma&#x2019;s novel, <em>Problems,</em> is that it ends. The narrator, Maya, is a hot mess with zero percent of her shit together, and yet as I got to know her through the Sharma&#x2019;s inventive narrative voice, I saw her as&#x2014;or perhaps wanted her to be&#x2014;my friend.&#x201d; <strong><em>&#x2014;The Rumpus</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Maya&#x2019;s reflections on being Indian American when &#x2018;the whole world wants young white girls&#x2019; do more to show the damage of internalized white supremacy than many of today&#x2019;s internet-published hot takes.&#x201d; <strong><em>&#x2014;Bitch Magazine</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Problems is a book that wrestles with you; you will try to put it down but you&#x2019;ll be unsuccessful. And when you finish reading, it will feel like a masochistic act. But like any great character, Maya will linger with you, so you can struggle together.&#x201d;<strong><em>&#x2014;Bust</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Maya, with her bodily neuroses and impulses and lusts and bolts of cleverly crafted philosophical insight, is the novel. And she&#x2019;s hard to stop watching and caring about and even, optimistically, rooting for. . . . A psychologically astute portrait of a woman&#x2019;s cycle of addiction, the ebb and flow of her life around it, and her own hilarious, bittersweet and brilliant inner monologue through it all.&#x201d; <strong><em>&#x2014;Huffington Post</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Problems unnerves in its facility to careen between acidic humor and frank depictions of desperation, as well as in its refusal to disavow completely the allure of the high.&#x201d;<strong><em>&#x2014;Literary Hub</em></strong><br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Problems is a book that demands to be read in a gulp from its first sentence...&#x201d;&#x2014;<strong><em>The Bookends Review</em></strong><br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;It's simultaneously hilarious, sexy, and heartbreaking.&#x201d;&nbsp;<strong><em>&#x2014;</em></strong><strong><em>Bustle</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;I love how raw this book is. It&#x2019;s very stream of consciousness, and it&#x2019;s told with a mordant sense of humor too.&#x201d; <strong><em>&#x2014;Word of Mouth</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Binging and purging, a bad relationship with her MS-afflicted mother, a bad relationship with most people: Sharma smartly treats these as things to endure rather than as things to address.&#x201d; <strong><em>&#x2014;Electric Literature</em></strong><br><br>"[<em>Problems</em> is] complex and unflinching, but it's among those messy ruins of her self-made life that I found myself feeling oddly and genuinely uplifted." <strong><em>&#x2014;Guernica</em></strong><br><p>&#x201c;Jade Sharma's great gift is in how she makes the reader addicted to the addict.&#x201d;&nbsp;<strong><em>&#x2014;Independent</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;<em>Problems</em> is, indeed, a funny book, but it&#x2019;s hardly a comedy. It is brutal, sarcastic, often startling in its depictions of sex, sex work, drug use, and disordered eating habits &#x2013; but these highlight rather than distract from the deep vulnerability at its core.&#x201d;&nbsp;<strong><em>&#x2014;New Statesman</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Problems is filled with sharp dialogue, perfectly crafted one-liners and succinct observations...&#x201d;&nbsp;<strong><em>&#x2014;The Guardian</em></strong></p><br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s very little ease to start in <em>Problems,</em> a debut novel about addiction from the deceptively sober perspective of a bona fide anti-heroine.&#x201d; <strong><em>&#x2014;Bookforum</em></strong><br><br>"Jade Sharma's <em>Problems</em> is one of the year's strongest debut novels, a powerful book that deals with addiction and gender politics through the eyes of its unforgettable and vividly drawn protagonist." <strong><em>&#x2014;Largehearted Boy</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;First out of the gate for the new venture is the utterly ambitious and unique <em>Problems,</em> a debut novel from Jade Sharma that offers a disturbing, but also humorous, glimpse into heroin addiction and the end of a crumbling marriage. . . .

He was born in Hong Kong shortly after World War II and at a very early age began training in Chinese martial arts.<br> <br>Studying under masters such as Lung Tse Chung and Yim Sheung Mo (both of whom were disciples of Ku Yue Chang, known throughout China as &#x201c;The King of Iron Palm&#x201d;), he was trained in Choy Lee Fut, Northern Shaolin Kung Fu and Iron Palm, as well as Tai Chi.<br> <br>He then studied Chinese medicine, becoming a qualified bonesetter and herbalist, and opened a school and clinic in Hong Kong. He also undertook the study of Chi Kung, a system for the cultivation of internal energy in the body. Using his medical skills and his knowledge of Chi Kung he began to develop a new form of Tai Chi, now known as Lam Style Tai Chi.<br> <br>Master Lam came to the West in 1976 when he became the first Tai Chi instructor appointed to teach in the Inner London Education Authority. In 1987 he gave the first European demonstration of the art of Zhan Zhuang Chi Kung, which he studied in Beijing under Professor Yu Yong Nian, the world's leading authority. He now teaches and practices medicine at The Lam Clinic in London's Chinatown.<br> <br>Following the widely acclaimed BBC series, <i>The Way of the Warrior</i>, Master Lam was invited to act as consultant to the sequel publication, <i>The Way of Harmony.</i> This was followed by his ground-breaking work published by Gaia Books, <i>The Way of Energy,</i> introducing the Zhan Zhuang system of &#x201c;Standing Like a Tree&#x201d;.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br><b>FUNDAMENTAL MOVEMENTS</b><br><br>This set of basic exercises is designed to relax and tone all the major joints in your body. Starting with the neck, you work down through your entire frame. For the best results from these exercises, you should work through the full set in the correct order.<br><br>The movements are simple to learn. Most of them are based on the natural action of the joints when they are relaxed and free from tension. For this reason, if you are just starting to learn Tai Chi you should begin with this sequence to ensure that you develop a good foundation of smooth, relaxed movement.<br><br>These fundamental exercises are presented in a way that will be particularly helpful to anyone who has never done slow exercise before. They are ideal if you are out of shape, recuperating from an illness or a physical injury, or are elderly. Follow the instructions carefully, go slowly, and don't strain yourself in any movement and the benefits can be remarkable.<br><br>The exercises are based on two principles. First, there is a great deal of tension in our joints and their associated muscles. It is essential, therefore, to learn how to relax these areas in order to keep them supple and to help overcome the damaging effects tension has on the body. Second, all our major energy pathways pass through the joints. If tension exists there, then the natural flow of energy in the body will be blocked, leading to increased stress and, eventually, illness. So these exercises, simple as they may seem at first, meet some of our most fundamental needs.<br><br>Each exercise is described in detail, including the starting position for each, the precise movement, the pauses, and the all-important concluding moments of stillness. Many of these features are common to each exercise, but they are repeated so that you can be sure that at each stage you know exactly what you are supposed to be doing.<br><br><b>EXERCISE ROUTINES</b><br><br>Working through the full set of 18 fundamental exercises gently and slowly, as described on the preceding pages, takes just under 10 minutes. You should start at this level, carefully making all the movements in order, pausing briefly in between each one, until you are familiar with the full set. The number of repetitions to start with for each exercise is set out in Level 1 on the chart opposite.<br><br>If you are unfamiliar with this type of slow exercise, or you are out of shape, in poor health, or elderly, take your time and do them as gently as possible. This way, without straining yourself, you will start to make progress each time you do them. Some people may prefer to remain at this basic level, doing the movements as best they can. Even if this is the only exercise you can take, it will be of great benefit to you.<br><br>Once you are familiar with the exercises, and if you find that you can do them fairly easily, there are two further levels set out on the chart opposite.

Jody lives in central Michigan with her husband, five busy children, and five spoiled cats. When she&#x2019;s not penning another of her page-turning stories, she loves to spend her time reading, especially when it also involves consuming coffee and chocolate.Prolific Hedlund is back with another tale of medieval romance, a sequel to An Uncertain Choice (2015). Lady Juliana of Wessex lives in the forest, disguised as a boy, stealing to provide for the remnants of her father's uprising against her vicious uncle. She doesn't want to steal but must even though she is the rightful heir to the rich Wessex lands. But she goes too far when she tries to steal from the lord of the neighboring Goodrich lands and is injured in the process. Collin Goodrich has seen through her disguise and takes her to his castle to protect her. Their friendship builds and warms into a budding romance...until Collin's sister invites the Wessex usurpers into the Goodrich home. Juliana's no longer safe---and now neither is Collin. Hedlund's light on historical detail and makes no apparent attempt to find a medieval voice to suit the 1390 English setting. Nevertheless, this narrative told from Juliana's and Collin's alternating points of view has engaging-enough characters and plenty of derring-do to entertain young romance enthusiasts. Formulaic but fun for genre fans wanting a quick read. (Historical romance. 12-16) (<i>Kirkus</i>)<br><br>The Cloaked Bandit has been robbing the noble families of Wessex for years and has yet to be caught. Skilled at hiding in the forests, this bandit is able to conceal the fact that she is a girl, Juliana Wessex, and a member of the ruling family, who everyone believes is dead. Her talents allow her to feed and shelter the peasants of the land. While playing this Robin Hood&#x2013;like role, she encounters Collin Goodrich, who recognizes her from years past. He encourages her to stay on his estate after she is injured, and teens will want to read on to find out if Collin is able to win her heart and if he will sacrifice everything for her. While Juliana and Collin are interesting characters and the action is easy to follow, the story is idealistic as opposed to realistic. While Juliana is 17, she doesn&#x2019;t sound authentically teen, though falling in love and resisting temptation will be themes that will resonate with some young adults. The book includes discussion questions in the back matter relating to its Christian motifs. VERDICT A great selection for collections looking for titles with strong Christian themes or for readers who enjoy fairy tales. (<i>School Library Journal</i>)<br><br>Historical fiction author Jody Hedlund writes her second young adult novel about a fourteenth-century young woman living an unconventional life. In A Daring Sacrifice, Juliana Wessex is the rightful ruler of Wessex. But the current Lord Wessex (her uncle) believes she died three years ago when her father lost his life. Juliana hides in the forest and steals to provide a livelihood for the peasants on her land, impoverished by her uncle&#x2019;s harsh rule. It is a life filled with risks and danger, and she struggles with the justification of her actions. When she is forced to flee Wessex after escaping capture, Juliana makes the mistake of trying to rob Colin Goodrich, who recognizes Juliana by her red hair. Colin takes her to his castle after she is injured and introduces her as a distant cousin. But her uncle discovers her presence. To what lengths will her uncle go to keep Wessex for himself? Who makes the daring sacrifice? Different text fonts indicate Juliana&#x2019;s and Colin&#x2019;s points of view. The spiritual element is evident but not heavy-handed; Colin and Juliana ask for God&#x2019;s leading and try to live godly lives, which is especially hard for Juliana since she steals from the nobility. Filled with descriptive narrative and endearing characters, A Daring Sacrifice is an entertaining read&#x2013;except for the necessary violence in the fighting scenes. Its believable plot has enough twists in the last third of the book to keep the reader up late! Fans of Lisa Bergren&#x2019;s River of Time series, Dina Sleiman&#x2019;s Valiant Hearts series, and Melanie Dickerson&#x2019;s medieval young adult books will also enjoy Hedlund&#x2019;s medieval trilogy. Readers may want to read Hedlund&#x2019;s An Uncertain Choice (reviewed in Christian Library Journal, Jan/Feb/Mar/Apr 2015). A third book is in the works.

Though she has written poetry throughout her lifetime, she did not seek to publish her works until long after her husband&#x2019;s death. Her first collection of poems, <i>An Altogether Different Language</i>, was a 1994 National Book Award Finalist.The last book of poems from Anne Porter, the widow of painter Fairfield Porter, was a 1999 National Book Award finalist An Altogether Different Language. This book reprints the 80-odd poems of that collection and adds 44 more of Porter's beautiful hymns to light, to friends and family, and to God, "an aeon / Of refining fire." Porter writes what might best be called plainsong: short, unadorned works that, like gospel or folk music, cut directly to the ambiguous heart of things. Among the new poems, there is "A Short Prayer" to Mary, paeans to friends Emmett Kelly and Terry Berrigan (as well as to "3 Birds," "The Roofs of Paris" and "The Song of the Wren"), and depictions of everything from "A Painter's Life" to "A Turtle's Shell" (the two poems appear back-to-back). It is a beautiful book, one in which fans of Virginian Hamilton Adair, Amy Clampitt and James Schuyler (often a guest at the Porter home) will find "That secret other poetry / Which never will be written." <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

As Niels Bohr said, if you weren&#x2019;t shocked by quantum theory, you didn&#x2019;t really understand it. For most people, quantum theory is synonymous with mysterious, impenetrable science. And in fact for many years it was equally baffling for scientists themselves. In this tour de force of science history, Manjit Kumar gives a dramatic and superbly written account of this fundamental scientific revolution, focusing on the central conflict between Einstein and Bohr over the nature of reality and the soul of science. This revelatory book takes a close look at the golden age of physics, the brilliant young minds at its core&#x2015;and how an idea ignited the greatest intellectual debate of the twentieth century. 16 pages of photographs</p><p>Manjit Kumar has degrees in physics and philosophy and has written for Slate, The Guardian, the Times Literary Supplement, The Independent, and New Scientist. He lives in London.Perhaps not to the casual listener&#39;s taste, Kumar&#39;s history of the development of quantum theory and the weight of work that has been undertaken to explain these difficult phenomena is a wonderful experience for lovers of physics. In this audiobook, complicated scientific theorems and, at times, almost mind-bendingly complex discussions regarding elements, atomic weights, experiments, and chains of formulae are easily dealt with by Ray Porter, who demonstrates a relaxed familiarity with technical matter. Porter re-creates the lives and times of the great scientists Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, Marie Curie, and Ernest Rutherford, among others, who played their parts in the advancement of this dynamic new physics.

At the head of this effort was Jun�pero Serra, an ambitious Franciscan who hoped to convert California Indians to Catholicism and turn them into European-style farmers. For his efforts, he has been beatified by the Catholic Church and widely celebrated as the man who laid the foundation for modern California. But his legacy is divisive. The missions Serra founded would devastate California's Native American population, and much more than his counterparts in colonial America, he remains a contentious and contested figure to this day.</p><p>Steven W. Hackel's groundbreaking biography, <i>Jun�pero Serra: California's Founding Father</i>, is the first to remove Serra from the realm of polemic and place him within the currents of history. Born into a poor family on the Spanish island of Mallorca, Serra joined the Franciscan order and rose to prominence as a priest and professor through his feats of devotion and powers of intellect. But he could imagine no greater service to God than converting Indians, and in 1749 he set off for the new world. In Mexico, Serra first worked as a missionary to Indians and as an uncompromising agent of the Inquisition. He then became an itinerant preacher, gaining a reputation as a mesmerizing orator who could inspire, enthrall, and terrify his audiences at will. With a potent blend of Franciscan piety and worldly cunning, he outmaneuvered Spanish royal officials, rival religious orders, and avaricious settlers to establish himself as a peerless frontier administrator. In the culminating years of his life, he extended Spanish dominion north, founding and promoting missions in present-day San Diego, Los Angeles, Monterey, and San Francisco. But even Serra could not overcome the forces massing against him. California's military leaders rarely shared his zeal, Indians often opposed his efforts, and ultimately the missions proved to be cauldrons of disease and discontent. Serra, in his hope to save souls, unwittingly helped bring about the massive decline of California's indigenous population.</p><p>On the three-hundredth anniversary of Jun�pero Serra's birth, Hackel's complex, authoritative biography tells the full story of a man whose life and legacies continue to be both celebrated and denounced. Based on exhaustive research and a vivid narrative, this is an essential portrait of America's least understood founder.</p></p><p><b>Steven W.

He lives in Riverside, California.ONE <br>&nbsp; <br> <br>Mallorca <br>&nbsp; <br>The man whom Californians know as Father Serra came from Mallorca, an island whose rich and complex history shaped his life and character and gave him direction and identity through all of his days. The largest island in a chain known as the Baleares and equidistant from the coasts of Spain and Africa, Mallorca was for thousands of years a center of trade and thus a place where diverse peoples came into contact with one another. Economically, religiously, and culturally, it was deeply integrated into a larger Mediterranean and European world, yet it did not share the region&#x2019;s characteristic and salutary lushness. For most of its history, and in particular between Serra&#x2019;s birth in 1713 and his departure for Mexico in 1749, Mallorca was in fact an arid and unforgiving land, one stalked by disease and famine and surrounded by enemies both real and imaginary. Rival imperial powers desired Mallorca for its strategic location; conquest and religious conflict marked the island and remade its peoples. Mallorcans alternated between a wary embrace of others and violent attempts to convert, enslave, or expel those with different beliefs and customs. But because of the island&#x2019;s small size and history of famine, Mallorcans also came to look longingly beyond their shores, first across the Mediterranean Sea for material sustenance and then across the Atlantic Ocean for spiritual fulfillment. It is no coincidence that Jun�pero Serra, an ardent, crusading, and hardened Franciscan missionary, came from Mallorca. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Mallorcan summers are warm, and its winters are cool. Summer days stretch to nearly fifteen hours, and winter days bring just over nine hours of light. A dusting of winter snow in the mountains is not uncommon in the northwest and southeast, but it rarely snows on the agricultural plain that stretches between the ranges. In general, precipitation is light. Summer is characterized by drought, and there are no rivers that flow throughout the year. As a result agriculture is precarious: the island has more often than not failed to produce enough food for its inhabitants. Since Mallorca is relatively small, only about fourteen hundred square miles, a man on horseback or foot could traverse the island in a matter of days. Mallorca&#x2019;s best natural harbor, now known as Palma, is in the southwest, away from the mountains and just to the west of the agricultural plain. <br>Archaeological evidence suggests that people have been living on Mallorca for more than seven thousand years.1 A turning point in the island&#x2019;s early history came in 123 B.C.E. when Rome conquered the Talaiotic peoples of the Balearic Islands; later, through the Roman Empire, Christianity came to Mallorca. By the beginning of the fifth century C.E., if not earlier, it was the island&#x2019;s dominant religion.2 Soon after, the Vandals and then the Byzantine emperor Justinian conquered the island. The Byzantines would abandon the Balearics in 624, and for centuries thereafter both African Muslims and European Christians raided the islands. African Muslims had taken most of the Iberian Peninsula by 711, but it was not until 902 that they arrived on Mallorca, introducing not only Islam but also windmills and waterwheels turned by animals, improving irrigation and agriculture, and in other ways helping the island prosper.3 <br>Given the island&#x2019;s importance in Mediterranean trade and the growing European commerce with Africa in the Middle Ages, rival European kingdoms desired to retake the island from the Muslims.4 In 1229, Catalan troops led by the Catholic king of Aragon, James I (1208&#x2013;1276), &#x201c;the Conqueror,&#x201d; captured Medina Mayurqa, as Palma, Mallorca&#x2019;s best natural harbor, was then known.5 As king of Mallorca, James I distributed land to his followers and transported Christian religious orders and mendicant priests to Mallorca. Both the Dominicans and the Franciscans arrived in the 1230s. In 1238, Franciscans received land in Palma to build a convent, but construction of the influential Convento de San Francisco did not begin until 1281.6 By the middle of the fourteenth century, the convent had more than sixty Franciscans.7 <br>Upon his death in 1276, James I divided his kingdom between his two sons, James II of Mallorca (1243&#x2013;1311) and Peter III, &#x201c;the Great&#x201d; (1239&#x2013;1285). Almost two decades of political unrest ensued. After swearing his allegiance to his brother&#x2019;s son who had become king of Aragon, James II began to carve out a separate existence for the kingdom of Mallorca. He created a standard currency, imposed taxes on Catalan merchants, and formally recognized the governing bodies of the small agricultural communities across the island, ushering in a period of economic expansion. Because of the island&#x2019;s location as a mercantile entrep�t, many Mallorcans made their living as sailors, pilots, fishermen, merchants, shipwrights, and hired hands. Palma soon rivaled Barcelona as a major port, especially after the pope granted Mallorcan merchants the special privilege to trade with non-Catholics in Africa, as long as they traded for food, something that was necessary given that the island was nearly always threatened by famine.8 As early as 1280, Mallorcan ships had sailed for London loaded with commodities, among the most important of which was wool. And Mallorcans, in particular Jews, cultivated a profitable and busy trade with North Africa.9 Mallorcan culture flourished during this period as well; Palma&#x2019;s Jewish cartographers, for instance, created some of the most important and widely used atlases of the Middle Ages. <br>Owing to the influence of the colorful, brilliant, and ascetic Franciscan tertiary Ramon Llull (1232&#x2013;c. 1315), Mallorca in these years became a center of Catholicism and a breeding ground for Catholic missionaries.10 After a series of religious visions, Llull committed himself to three pursuits: converting the &#x201c;unbelievers&#x201d;; writing a book, the &#x201c;best in the world, against the errors of the unbelievers&#x201d;; and encouraging the pope, kings, and &#x201c;Christian princes&#x201d; to support monasteries in which missionaries would learn the languages of the &#x201c;unbelievers.&#x201d; Llull espoused the belief that all non-Catholics&#x2014;by which he meant primarily Jews and Muslims&#x2014;could be converted, not by war, but by reason.11 He traveled to Africa to preach and learned Arabic so that he could do so in the local tongue. He established a missionary college in the hills above Palma, where he trained followers, and Mallorca became a launching point for Catholic missionaries bound for Africa, the Holy Land, or the Canary Islands, off Africa&#x2019;s Atlantic coast.12 Soon destroyed by slave traders, the Canary Island missions nevertheless helped to set a pattern of Mallorcan Franciscan missionaries venturing far from their home island.13 Llull himself died in 1315 or 1316, most likely in Mallorca, although some have suggested that he died in Tunis at the hands of Muslims who repudiated his teachings, or on a ship sailing back to his homeland. His bones were interred in the sacristy and then the pulpit of the church of the Convento de San Francisco in Palma.14 <br>Mallorcan independence came to an end in 1343 when Peter IV of Aragon, &#x201c;the Ceremonious&#x201d; (1319&#x2013;1387), conquered the island to protect Barcelona&#x2019;s supremacy.15 The attempt of James III of Mallorca (1315&#x2013;1349) to liberate the island in 1349 failed, not least because the Black Death had struck the year before, thinning the ranks of his supporters.16 The island remained under the Crown of Aragon&#x2019;s firm control and was governed from the mainland.17 Yet the cultural and economic achievements of its period of independence&#x2014;and its political subjugation at the hands of outsiders&#x2014;would long remain central to Mallorcan identity. <br>Loss of its independence coupled with the Black Death made the Middle Ages one of the darkest periods in Mallorca&#x2019;s history. As a center of trade, the island was especially vulnerable to contagious epidemics, and the plague continued to strike, carrying off twenty thousand souls on the island in 1481 alone.18 Not until 1573 did the island&#x2019;s population top sixty thousand for the first time since 1329.19 The plague also straitened Mallorca&#x2019;s foreign trade; as a result, the island underwent an economic transformation, turning to the production of textiles and wool,20 and so becoming ever more dependent on imported grains.21 <br>The combined pressures of plague, famine, and economic decline threw much of Spain, including Mallorca, into turmoil, leading many to blame the Jews among them for their hardships; a wave of anti-Jewish violence had begun earlier in Seville, and it soon swept the island. The Jewish quarter of Palma was sacked in August 1391 by a mob of some seven thousand Catholic assailants, who massacred three hundred Jews.22 In the following months, five hundred Jews converted to Catholicism. Catholic religious authorities forced the mass conversion of many of the island&#x2019;s remaining Jews in 1435.23 Public displays of Islam had already largely been rooted out of the island, and now Mallorca became among the first Spanish regions in which the open practice of Judaism disappeared.24 In Mallorca some fifteen hundred conversos (Jews who had been forced to convert to Catholicism) lived apart from Catholics in Palma.25 <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>By the late fifteenth century, with the plague having largely finished its deadly work on the Iberian Peninsula, the kingdom of Castile was ascendant. In 1478 it conquered the Canary Islands, and then in 1492 it took Granada, the last Muslim kingdom on the peninsula, sent Columbus on his voyage across the Atlantic, and expelled from its territories all Jews who refused to convert to Christianity. Mallorca, however, was still part of the Crown of Aragon, which remained largely separate from imperial Spain even after the houses of Castile and Aragon were joined through the marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella in 1469 and later during Spain&#x2019;s unification under a single Hapsburg monarch in the early sixteenth century.26 <br>The persistent inability of the Mallorcan economy to feed the island&#x2019;s residents was exacerbated by the Little Ice Age, a drop in temperatures that devastated agricultural production across much of Europe between 1550 and 1700.27 In these years of recurrent famine, Mallorcans devoted themselves to agriculture but still had to import grains from Sardinia, Naples, Genoa, North Africa, and Castile.28 The island plunged into debt.29 As one astute observer noted in 1632, &#x201c;It is certain, that if the scarcity of Corn did not oblige them sometimes to send Money out of the Countrey, this Kingdom would be one of the richest in Europe.&#x201d;30 The majority of the people of the countryside saw their own economic condition worsen, and more became renters or simply field hands. Meanwhile, a long period of discrimination against Mallorcan Muslims, many of whom were enslaved, culminated in 1609, when King Philip III forced all Moriscos&#x2014;Muslims converted to Catholicism&#x2014;to leave Spain for Muslim North Africa.31 <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>In the seventeenth century, Spain&#x2019;s trade with American colonies fell off, as did the influx of treasure from the New World, and plague once again reared its head. In 1600, Spain&#x2019;s population was around 8.5 million; a century later it had been reduced to approximately 7.5 million.32 All told, over the course of the seventeenth century, more than 1.25 million people died from the disease in Spain; another 500,000 immigrated to the Americas.33 In Mallorca, more than 20,000, or 25 percent of the population, died in the epidemic of 1652 alone.34 In one of the island&#x2019;s towns, Inca, about 40 percent of the population perished.35 As the population declined, the burden of taxation on survivors only seemed to increase. Making matters worse, across Spain agricultural production plummeted. In the Mallorcan countryside, the dire economic situation spawned peasant unrest and banditry. Adding to the island&#x2019;s woes were the periodic attacks on coastal towns by Muslim, Turkish, and even French raiders.36 <br>The only stable institution in Mallorca across these centuries was the Catholic Church. Mallorca had over three hundred parish priests and hundreds more clergymen who served in the religious orders.37 The great wealth of the Church was conspicuous amid Spain&#x2019;s general economic malaise. For adult males the priesthood was a common career choice. Outside the priesthood, formal education and literacy were unusual. On Mallorca basic education was limited and overseen by the Church. <br>One of the principal responsibilities of Mallorcan priests was to teach young children the catechism. Every Sunday and throughout Lent and days of obligation, the rector would ring the church bell to call children to church for instruction. The catechism would be taught and recited in Mallorqu�, the Mallorcan variety of the Catalan language, or in Latin, not Castilian. And most likely the children would have been instructed in a very basic catechism, either the Doctrina Christiana of Padre Diego de Ledesma or a translation of the Ripalda Catechism.38 <br>In Mallorca, the ritual calendar of the Catholic Church structured village and family life. There were more than one hundred additional Catholic feast days, not including Sundays. Church attendance was expected, if not mandated, on Sundays, and all adults were required to go to confession and receive Communion at least once a year, usually during Lent, when some adults fasted and others abstained from eating meat and all foods prepared with eggs or milk.39 Church leaders considered many Mallorcans to be lax in their faith and observances, and so welcomed itinerant missionaries who periodically crisscrossed the island trying to reinvigorate the spiritual lives of the laity.40 Typically, these missions were composed of small groups of traveling friars who spent twenty to thirty days in one of the island&#x2019;s small communities trying to shore up villagers&#x2019; faith.41 <br>During the seventeenth century, as the Hapsburg monarchs struggled to rule Spain in the shadow of the glories of an earlier age, Mallorca felt the pains of Spanish imperial decline. Mallorcans were repeatedly called upon to help defray the costs of lodging troops on their island, and many young Mallorcan men were pressed into military service.42 Once again, hardship and uncertainty spurred fears about insidious Jewish activity on the island. In 1677 the Inquisition arrested 237 conversos, accusing them of cryptojudaism.43 Most were given jail sentences of two years or so. A decade later, though, when a group of those previously punished prepared to flee to Holland, and one Raphael Cort�s de Alfonso reported to a Jesuit priest that he suspected his cousin and others of &#x201c;observing the Law of Moses,&#x201d; a cycle of devastating denunciations unfolded. Hundreds were arrested and accused of faking their conversions. In 1691&#x2014;merely one generation before Jun�pero Serra&#x2019;s birth&#x2014;the Inquisition found forty-five men and women guilty of practicing cryptojudaism. Five who had already died or fled were burned in effigy. The remaining condemned were publicly ridiculed in central Palma and then paraded to the outskirts of town, where more than thirty thousand people&#x2014;a huge proportion of the island&#x2019;s population&#x2014;thronged to watch the executions. Thirty-seven were strangled and then burned. Three, who refused to renounce their religious beliefs, were set on fire alive.44 The Jewish community in Palma never fully recovered, and the persecutions became an important part of the island&#x2019;s culture, bringing religious intolerance ever closer to the center of Mallorcan identity.45 <br>Despite having to support Hapsburg troops, Mallorca remained relatively free from imperial ov...</p><h2>Bobby Flay&#39;s Throwdown!: More Than 100 Recipes from Food Network&#39;s Ultimate Cooking Challenge: A Cookbook</h2><p>Are <i>you</i> ready? <br>&nbsp;<br>Every week on <i>Throwdown!,</i> celebrity chef and restaurateur Bobby Flay goes head-to-head with cooks who have staked their claim as masters of an iconic dish&#x2014;buffalo wings, chicken cacciatore, or sticky buns, for example&#x2014;even though he may never have cooked these things before.

I have been an avid reader since the age of seven. Having begun with the Bobbsey Twins and Nancy Drew, I moved to the richer fare of <i>Jane Eyre</i> and <i>Little Women, Gone With the Wind</i> and <i>To Kill a Mockingbird.</i> Because of my frequent airplane trips, I have recently been reading a number of best-sellers. On my way to New Zealand I found myself stranded in Honolulu for a day because of airplane troubles, and spent the time mesmerized by <i>Presumed Innocent.</i> Curled up in a wicker chair at the Sheraton Hotel I read for hours, fascinated by the unfolding of the story, by the rich characters, and by what the book was telling me about obsession and marriage, politics and power. When I watched the film the story came to the forefront. I wanted to be able to follow every clue, to watch it unravel, and to clarify some of the parts of the book that I'd forgotten. When the film worked well, the story was clear and involving. At other times I was confused and bewildered, which lessened my enjoyment of it. But the experience of reading a novel is quite different from watching a film. And it's exactly this difference that fights translationinto film. When we read a novel, time is on our side. It is not just a chronological experience, where someone else determines our pacing, but a reflective experience. Rarely do we read a novel in one sitting. In fact, part of the joy of reading is going back to the book. The reading, putting it down, thinking about it, sometimes reading a page twice is part of the pleasure. It is a reveling in the language as much as reveling in the story. THE IMPORTANCE OF THEME Novels, unlike films or plays, communicate all their information through words. The words express much more than story and events, images and character--they express ideas. Occasionally you do see a novel that is purely story--usually a short novel that's not particularly known for its literary merits. All of the great novels, however, and most of the good ones, are not just telling a story but are pursuing an idea. They are about something significant, and this theme is just as important as the story line, if not more so. The best films also have strong themes, but in a film the theme serves the story. It's there to reinforce and dimensionalize the story, not to replace it. In a novel, the story often serves the theme. The book <i>Gone With the Wind</i> is as much about the lost South as it is about Scarlett's relationships and struggles. The theme gives depth to the story. When I watch the film, however, the story sweeps me along. The story becomes the most important and the idea about the lost South is not what I remember best. I remember Scarlett and Rhett and the burning of Atlanta and Melanie and Ashley. The novel gives me many more layers. It follows its thematic line by building up detail after detail, page after page, about the manners and rituals and parties and hierarchies of the South. Even the characters reinforce the theme. In passages such as thefollowing, the characters are defined thematically, in terms of how they relate to the Old South. Although born to the ease of plantation life, waited on hand and foot since infancy, the faces of the three on the porch [Scarlett and the Tarleton twins] were neither slack nor soft. They had the vigor and alertness of country people who have spent all their lives in the open and troubled their heads very little with dull things in books. Life in the north Georgia county of Clayton was still new and, according to the standards of Augusta, Savannah and Charleston, a little crude. The more sedate and older sections of the South looked down their noses at the upcountry Georgians, but here in north Georgia, a lack of the niceties of classical education carried no shame, provided a man was smart in the things that mattered. And raising good cotton, riding well, shooting straight, dancing lightly, squiring the ladies with elegance and carrying one's liquor like a gentleman were the things that mattered. As the book unfolds, we see the disappearance of this way of life and how the characters react to the New South. Scarlett, through many compromises, is able to bend with the new era of Reconstruction. The book-loving, less practical Ashley is not. Rhett finds his integrity in the New South. Frank Kennedy becomes a hero while trying to preserve certain values of the Old South. In the beginning of the film <i>Gone With the Wind,</i> words on a scroll sum up this important theme from the book: <i>There was a land of Cavaliers and Cotton Fields called the Old South ...</i> <i>Here in this patrician world the</i> <i>Age of Chivalry took its last bow ...</i> &nbsp; <br> <i>Here was the last ever to be seen</i> <i>of Knights and their Ladies Fair,</i> <i>of Master and Slave ...</i> <i>Look for it only in books, for it</i> <i>is not more than a dream remembered,</i> <i>a Civilization gone with the wind ...</i> As the novel explores the idea of the lost South, it also takes its time giving us other layers of the story. BUILDING UP DETAIL Have you ever noticed that a book may take fifty or one hundred pages to give you the information that you get in three minutes of film? In <i>Bonfire of the Vanities,</i> the events in the first fourteen minutes of the film take up about eighty-nine pages in the book. When I worked on the adaptation of <i>Christy</i> by Catherine Marshall, the first image we created for the film corresponded to thirty-two pages of the book. Even in a short novel such as <i>58</i> <i>Minutes</i> (the basis of the film <i>Die Hard 2)</i>, it took forty-six pages in the book to create what we see in the first few minutes of the film. In <i>Gone With the Wind,</i> what happens in the first one hundred twenty-seven pages of the book is presented to us in less than thirty minutes of film. Film is much faster. It builds up its details through images. The camera can look at a three-dimensional object and, in a matter of seconds, get across details that would take pages in the novel. Film can give us story information, character information, ideas and images and style all in the same moment. When we read a novel, we can see only what the narrator shows us at that particular moment. If the narrator puts the focus on action in those pages, then we follow the action. If the narrator talks about feelings, then we focus on the feelings. We can receive only one piece of information at a time. A novel can only give us this information sequentially. But film is dimensional. A good scene in a film advances the action, reveals character, explores the theme, and builds an image. In a novel, one scene or an entire chapter may concentrate on only one of those areas. In the process of building up details, the novel is also communicating other information. When the novel <i>Gone With the Wind</i> takes several paragraphs to describe Ashley Wilkes, it is giving us important character information. But it's also using words to convey ideas about the kind of life Ashley was meant for--a gentleman's life in the Old South. It is building up details that will pay off in the last half of the book. Read this descriptive passage in which Gerald O'Hara describes Ashley: Our people and the Wilkes are different ... . They are queer folk, and it's best that they marry their cousins and keep their queerness to themselves ... . And when I say queer, it's not crazy I'm meaning. He's not queer like the Calverts who'd gamble everything they have on a horse, or the Tarletons who turn out a drunkard or two in every litter, or the Fontaines who are hot-headed little brutes and after murdering a man for a fancied slight ... . But he's queer in other ways ... . Now, Puss, tell me true, do you understand his folderol about books and poetry and music and oil paintings and such foolishness? Later, Ashley laments his lack of skills as he says to Scarlett: I don't want allowances made for me. I want to stand on my own feet for what I'm worth. What have I done with my life, up till now? ... I've been thinking. I don't believe I really thought from the time of the surrender until you went away from here. I was in a state of suspended animation and it was enough that I had something to eat and a bed to lie on. But when you went to Atlanta, shouldering a man's burden, I saw myself as much less than a man--much less, indeed, than a woman. Such thoughts aren't pleasant to live with and I do not intend to live with them any longer ... . This is my last chance ... . If I go to Atlanta and work for you, I'm lost forever. This character information connects ideas in various parts of the book. It builds up details and ideas about the Old South and the New South, about the world that has gone with the wind, about a man who can't adjust to the new world, and a woman who can. THE WORK OF THE NARRATOR As we read a novel, someone is taking us by the hand and leading us through the story. This narrator is sometimes a character (if the novel is in the first person) or the storyteller (usually the writer's alter ego), who explains to us the meaning of the events. When the narrator in <i>Gone With the Wind</i> tells us about the "pleasant land of white houses, peaceful plowed fields and sluggish yellow rivers ... a land of contrasts, of brightest sun glare and densest shade," the white columned house isn't there just as descriptive image; rather, the narrator is slowly giving us the details to help us understand what the world was like, and what the world would be losing. The cinematographer might show the exact same detail, but there is not the explanation with it to help us understand its deeper symbolic meaning. The narrator, however, is explaining and clarifying the connections. In many eighteenth-century novels, the narrator made him-or herself known to the reader. It was not unusual for the narrator to interrupt the story to lecture the "dear reader" and to tell readers what they are supposed to learn from the book. Henry Fielding, the author of <i>Tom Jones,</i> published in 1749, spends some time giving us insights into human nature. He then compliments himself on his astute observations by writing: As this is one of those deep observations which very few readers can be supposed capable of making themselves, I have thought proper to lend them my assistance; but this is a favour rarely to be expected in the course of my work. Indeed, I shall seldom or never so indulge him, unless in such instances as this, where nothing but theinspiration with which we writers are gifted can possibly enable any one to make the discovery. The narrator of <i>A Room with a View,</i> by E. M. Forster, has a less obtrusive function, as he continually keeps us informed that this is a novel about the theme of identity. He makes comments such as "It so happened that Lucy, who found daily life rather chaotic, entered a more solid world when she opened the piano"; and later, "She was accustomed to have her thoughts confirmed by others or, at all events, contradicted; it was too dreadful not to know whether she was thinking right or wrong." The narrator of <i>Gone With the Wind</i> reminds us of character details by telling us that "Scarlett O'Hara was not beautiful, but men seldom realized it when caught by her charm." In these cases, the narrator is calling attention to what we're supposed to notice, clarifying the issues, explaining the ideas, and telling us what is happening in the story. A narrator can move in and out of a character's life, even going inside a character's head to let us know how the character thinks and feels. This technique helps us understand even a negative character, eliciting our compassion because we have an inside view of motivation and emotions. We identify with the character psychologically, emotionally, and in terms of the action she or he takes. In a novel, the narrator stands between us and the story to help us understand and interpret events. When we watch a film, we are an objective observer of the actions. What we see is what we get. Even if characters tell us their feelings through a voice-over in a film, we may not believe them. Without the narrator to guide us, we may not know whether characters are lying or not. Does it matter? Yes, because we can trust the narrator in a novel, but we don't always trust the character. The narrator is omniscient. If the narrator of <i>A Room with a View</i> tells us that Lucy is really in love with George, we believe him. After all, he knows her better than we do, probably even better than Lucy knows herself. But in the film, if Lucy tells us that she doesn'tlove George, we don't know for sure whether to believe her. Perhaps she doesn't understand her own motives. Perhaps she's lying. Perhaps she only thinks that she doesn't love George in order to justify her engagement to Cecil. Lucy is not a trustworthy source. The narrator is. Any attempt to translate this interior understanding into film usually meets with failure. Film doesn't give us an interior look at a character. A novel does. THE REFLECTIVE VOICE What else do we discover by going within a character's head? A character, as well as the narrator, is able to give us insights into the human condition. The narrator can help us understand the character's psychology and help us understand all types of characters--from the inside out. In the novel <i>Ordinary People,</i> by Judith Guest, the character of Conrad (the young man who tries to commit suicide after the drowning of his brother) discusses the tension and unspoken problems in the family: This house. Too big for three people. Straining, he can barely hear the early-morning sounds of his father and mother organizing things, synchronizing schedules at the other end of the hall. It doesn't matter. He doesn't need to hear, and they would certainly not be talking about anything important. They would not be talking, for instance, about him. They are people of good taste. They do not discuss a problem in the presence of the problem. And besides, there is no problem. There is just Phase Two. Recovery. A moving forward. Note how the author carefully uses words as "synchronizing schedules" and "anything important" and "the problem" to build up the idea that the family avoids facing problems. There is no way to get across this type of detail in a film. THE NOVEL AS INFORMATION Details in a novel build ideas, but they also give us information that is useful and often fascinating in itself. This may be pages of information about whales (as in <i>Moby-Dick)</i> or information about outbreaks of contagious diseases (as in Robin Cook's novel <i>Outbreak)</i> or information about plantation life. In <i>Gone With the Wind,</i> one of the most exciting scenes is the burning of Atlanta. It occurs shortly after the memorable image of Scarlett walking among the wounded as she searches for Dr. Meade. In the book, the narrator describes this scene: Lying in the pitiless sun, shoulder to shoulder, head to feet, were hundreds of wounded men, lining the tracks, the sidewalks, stretched out in endless rows under the car shed. Some lay stiff and still but many writhed under the hot sun, moaning. Everywhere, swarms of flies hovered over the men, crawling and buzzing in their faces, everywhere was blood, dirty bandages, groans, screamed curses of pain as stretcher bearers lifted men. The smell of sweat, of blood, of unwashed bodies, of excrement rose up in waves of blistering heat until the fetid stench almost nauseated her.

What a life!</p><p>All I say is, kings is kings and you got to make allowances.</p><p>&#x2014;Mark Twain, <i>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i></p><p>Introduction</p><p>The twentieth century was a slaughterhouse for European monarchy. Across the continent, scores of kings and queens were swept from their thrones in a frenzy of war and revolution. Those managing to cling to their crowns, meanwhile, have been rendered either faceless and bland, as in, say, Norway, or, as in Britain, regarded as little more than inane tabloid fodder.</p><p>Maybe the decline of monarchy is for the best. After all, the notion that one individual&#x2014;no matter how stupid or depraved&#x2014;should by some fluke of birth hold dominion over all others is ridiculous and well past its prime. Still, there&#x2019;s a void now. People with unlimited power and an inbred sense of their own superiority tended to misbehave. Royally. Democratically elected presidents and prime ministers&#x2014;not to mention constitutionally constrained monarchs&#x2014;simply can&#x2019;t compete. Consequently, things are a lot duller these days, and what passes for scandal is almost laughable.</p><p>So what if Charles and Diana were miserably married? He never slammed the doors of Westminster Abbey in her face, or buried pieces of her boyfriend under the floorboards of his palace. That was behavior typical of a bygone era celebrated in this treasury&#x2014;a time of lusty kings and treacherous queens; of murderous tsars, insane emperors, and unholy popes (once the supreme monarchs in Europe). Toe sucking aside, Fergie and the rest of this generation&#x2019;s royals can&#x2019;t hold a scandal to their forbears. Not one of them has delivered anything worthy of the name, and are thus excluded from this collection.</p><p>Some of the stories that do appear here are no doubt familiar to readers of history. But they are classics, and no anthology of royal bad behavior would be complete without them. Others have been mined from the past, largely unexposed. All of the stories showcase the rich assortment of scandals that once flourished across Europe. And, thanks to the generations of royals who unwittingly created them, they remain immensely entertaining.</p><p>Family Trees</p><p><b>PART I</b></p><p><b> The Lust Emperors</b></p><p>&#x201c;<b>L</b>ust&#x2019;s passion will be served,&#x201d; the French libertine and novelist Marquis de Sade once wrote. &#x201c;It demands, it militates, it tyrannizes.&#x201d; The Marquis might have added that this relentless vice has always been oblivious to social status. So, the whole theory behind royalty&#x2014;that it conferred a certain exalted status over ordinary mortals; a place closer to God in the hierarchy of the universe&#x2014;was compromised somewhat by the fact that kings and queens proved themselves to be every bit as sex-driven as the peons who served them. The only difference was that, from their positions of power, royal folk were able to serve the demands of lust more creatively and energetically than most.</p><p>Henri III preening amongst his minions.</p><p><b>1</b></p><p><b>From Russia with Lots of Love</b></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b><i>C</i></b>atherine the Great loved horses. She also loved sex. Contrary to popular legend, however, she never managed to unite the two passions. Still, the autocratic empress of Russia brought all the enthusiasm of a vigorous ride to her extremely busy bedroom.</p><p>After ridding herself of her imbecile husband Peter III in 1762,1 Catherine grabbed the Russian crown and came to dominate her kingdom for the next thirty-four years. Boldly indulging herself as she grew more secure in her position, the empress consumed handsome young lovers with an appetite that sometimes shocked her contemporaries. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s no woman,&#x201d; exclaimed one, &#x201c;she&#x2019;s a siren!&#x201d;</p><p>The empress relished her weakness for men, abandoning herself to a giddy romanticism that belied her cold and pragmatic rule. She loved being entertained, even into old age, by a succession of well-formed young studs eager to please her. &#x201c;It is my misfortune that my heart cannot be content, even for one hour, without love,&#x201d; she wrote.</p><p>Sharing the empress&#x2019;s bed brought ample rewards, not the least of which was an intimate proximity to power, but getting there wasn&#x2019;t easy. A good body and a pleasant face, combined whenever possible with wit and intelligence, were merely starters. Potential lovers also had to have the right pedigree and pass a crucial test. Catherine had several ladies-in-waiting&#x2014;test drivers of sorts&#x2014;whose job it was to ensure that all candidates for their mistress&#x2019;s bed were up to the highly demanding task of satisfying her.</p><p>The applicants were most often supplied by the empress&#x2019;s one-eyed ex-lover&#x2014;the man many assumed to be her secret husband&#x2014;Gregory Potemkin. She had fallen in love with this rough, hulking officer relatively early in her industrious sexual career, overcome by his brash courage, quick wit, and almost primitive sexuality. Wasting little time disposing of Alexander Vassilzhikov, her boyfriend at the time, Catherine was delighted the first night Potemkin came to her bedroom, naked under his nightshirt and ready for action. &#x201c;I have parted from a certain excellent but very boring citizen,&#x201d; the empress wrote to a confidante, &#x201c;who has been replaced, I know not how, by one of the greatest, oddest, most amusing and original personalities of this Iron Age.&#x201d;</p><p>Because of his long greasy hair, and brutish unwashed body, many women found Potemkin repulsive. Catherine, however, reveled in his strength, charm, and sexual domination. She couldn&#x2019;t get enough of this strange man who made her forget her royal dignity. Whenever they were parted, even for a few hours, she regaled him with an avalanche of feverish love notes, each peppered with at least one of her special pet names: &#x201c;My marble beauty,&#x201d; &#x201c;my darling pet,&#x201d; &#x201c;my dearest doll,&#x201d; &#x201c;golden cock,&#x201d; &#x201c;lion of the jungle,&#x201d; &#x201c;my professional bon bon.&#x201d;</p><p>In one letter, she pretended to be shocked at the intensity of her passion and tried to get hold of herself: &#x201c;I have issued strict orders to my whole body, down to the smallest hair on my head, not to show you the least sign of love. I have locked my love inside my heart and bolted it ten times, it is suffocating there, it is constrained, and I fear it may explode.&#x201d; In other letters she gloried in his good company: &#x201c;Darling, what comical stories you told me yesterday! I can&#x2019;t stop laughing when I think of them . . . we spend four hours together without a shadow of boredom, and it is always with reluctance that I leave you. My dearest pigeon, I love you very much. You are handsome, intelligent, amusing.&#x201d;</p><p>Of course Catherine loved the sex, and in her exultation could sound much more like a bad romance novelist than the authoritarian empress of all the Russias:</p><p></p><p>&#x2014;&#x201c;There is not a cell in my whole body that does not yearn for you, oh infidel! . . .&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;&#x201c;I thank you for yesterday&#x2019;s feast. My little Grisha fed me and quenched my thirst, but not with wine. . . .&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;&#x201c;My head is like that of a cat in heat. . . .&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;&#x201c;I will be a &#x2018;woman of fire&#x2019; for you, as you so often say. But I shall try to hide my flames.&#x201d;</p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>Moody and temperamental, subject to bouts of black depression and fits of jealousy, Potemkin was sometimes lovingly scolded by his royal mistress: &#x201c;There is a woman in the world who loves you and who has a right to a tender word from you, Imbecile, Tatar, Cossack, infidel, Muscovite, <i>morbleu</i>! &#x201d; The relationship was so physically intimate that Catherine did not hesitate to share even the most unflattering of ailments with him: &#x201c;I have some diarrhea today, but apart from that, I am well, my adored one. . . . Do not be distressed because of my diarrhea, it cleans out the intestines.&#x201d;</p><p>There is no surviving evidence to support the rumor that Catherine secretly married Potemkin, although she often referred to him in her letters as &#x201c;my beloved spouse,&#x201d; or &#x201c;my dearest husband.&#x201d; Married or not, the relationship certainly transcended the bedroom as it evolved into a close political partnership. Catherine shared her vast kingdom with Potemkin as if he were her king. She consulted with him on all affairs of state, working closely with him on her ambitious plans to expand Russia&#x2019;s borders and crush the Muslim Turks.</p><p>The empress&#x2019;s powerful lover is perhaps best remembered for the legendary &#x201c;Potemkin Villages&#x201d; he is said to have created for her benefit as she embarked on a grand tour of all the newly Russianized lands he had conquered for her. These &#x201c;villages,&#x201d; it was said, were little more than elaborate stage sets of prosperous towns, populated by cheerful serfs, all of which were quickly collapsed and set up again at the next stop on Catherine&#x2019;s carefully plotted itinerary. The artificiality of the Potemkin Villages came to represent in the minds of many, Catherine&#x2019;s superficial and halfhearted attempts to reform and liberalize her kingdom.</p><p>Though the relationship with Potemkin endured until his death in 1791, the sexual intensity between them dimmed after only a few years. No longer champion of the empress&#x2019;s boudoir, Potemkin resolved to retain her favor by pimping his replacements. He handpicked a steady succession of new lovers for his erstwhile mistress&#x2014;all of whom paid him a handsome brokerage fee for the privilege of servicing her. There was Zavadovsky, followed by Zorich, followed by Rimsky-Korsakov, followed by Lanskoy, followed by Ermolov, followed by Mamonov and so on and on, and on.</p><p>After being installed in the official apartment set aside for Catherine&#x2019;s lovers, each new favorite was feted and adored by the passionate monarch with almost girlish enthusiasm. But each, in turn, was eventually dismissed, either for boring Catherine or breaking her heart. Few, however, left her service without a handsome settlement. When Zavadovsky was dismissed in 1776, for example, Chevalier de Corberon, the French charg� d&#x2019;affaires in Russia, wrote that &#x201c;He has received from Her Majesty 50,000 rubles, a pension of 5,000, and 4,000 peasants in the Ukraine, where they are worth a great deal [serfs at the time were trade-able commodities, like cattle]. . . . You must agree, my friend, that it&#x2019;s not a bad line of work to be in here.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>The 44-Gun Frigate USS Constitution &#39;Old Ironsides&#39; (Anatomy of The Ship)</h2><p>'Old Ironsides', as the USS Constitution is affectionately known, acquired her nickname during the dramatic confrontation with HMS Guerriere in 1812, during which the enemy's shot failed to penetrate her strong oak hull. By this time she was already fifteen years old. As one of the six original frigates ordered by George Washington on March 27th, 1794, she and her sisters represent the birth of the US Navy and she occupies a special place in its history. <br><br>In 1954 President Eisenhower signed into law the repair and restoration of Constitution as a museum vessel, and she has remained one of the major visitor attractions of the Boston National Historic Park since its inception twenty years later. In this brand new addition to the well-established and highly popular 'Anatomy' series, the author has compared draughts from the twentieth-century restorations with original plans from 1796 and drawings from her major refit in the 1840's, to produce, for the first time, and accurate set of plans for the frigate as she would have appeared during the Anglo-American War.<br><br>This volume Features:<br><br><li>A full description of one of the United States' most famous historic preserved ships in her 1812-1815 appearance<br></li><li>More than 250 perspective and 3-view drawings, with in-depth descriptive keys, of every detail of the ship - general arrangements, hull construction, fittings, masts, and yards, rigging, and sails, and armament<br></li><li>Pictorial section showing full-view and on-board photographs<br></li><li>One large-scale plan on the reverse of the fold-out jacket<br></li><li> A complete anatomy of the ship in words, photographs, and drawings.</li></p><p>Karl Heinz Marquardt is an internationally acclaimed draughtsman.

No aspect of agriculture is more fundamental and important, yet we have been losing vast quantities of our finite soil resources to erosion, pollution, and development.</p> <p>Now back in print, this eminently sensible and wonderfully well-focused book provides essential information about one of the most significant challenges for those attempting to grow delicious organic vegetables: the creation and maintenance of healthy soil.</p> <p>Chapter 2, "Understanding the Soil System," is alone worth the price of admission. Gershuny and Smillie give lay readers and experts a clear explanation of subjects--soil life and nutrient cycles--that have confounded most authors. Nowhere will the reader find simpler and more coherent descriptions of key concepts including cation exchange capacity and chelation.</p> <p>There are other books about soil available, including Grace Gershuny's comprehensive <em>Start with the Soil</em>, and there are books that feature chapters on soil building. What distinguishes <em>The Soil of Soil</em>is the authors' concise presentation; they give readers important information, including technical essentials, without getting bogged down in scientific or quasiscientific mumbo-jumbo. In addition, useful tables list specific compost materials, green manures, and other resources that allow growers to translate into action the more general information provided by the book.</p> <p>The soil-building techniques featured include:</p> <ul> <li>Organic matter management</li> <li>Building and maintaining humus</li> <li>On-site composting</li> <li>Green manures and rotations</li> <li>Cultivation and weed control</li> <li>Nutrient balances and soil testing</li> <li>Using mineral fertilizers</li> <li>Planning for organic certification</li> </ul> <p>Updates to the 1999 edition include analysis of Proposed Rules for the National Organic Standards, and expanded recommendations for private testing services and soil-testing equipment for home gardeners and organic farmers.</p> <p>All of us involved in the cultivation of plants--from the backyard gardener to the largest farmer--need to help regenerate a "living soil," for only in the diversity of the soil and its creatures can we ensure the long-term health of ourselves and our environment. <em>The Soul of Soil</em> offers everyone a basic understanding of what soil is and what we can do to improve our own patch of it. Seen in this light, this practical handbook will be an inspiration as well.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>Joe Smillie is the senior vice-president of Quality Assurance International, a leading organic certification agency.

Thompson, and it pretty much defined both his work and his life. Jann S. Wenner, the outlaw journalist&#x2019;s friend and editor for nearly thirty-five years, has assembled articles&#x2014;and a wealth of never- before-seen correspondence and internal memos from Hunter&#x2019;s storied tenure at <i>Rolling Stone</i>&#x2014;that begin with Thompson&#x2019;s infamous run for sheriff of Aspen on the Freak Party ticket in 1970 and end with his final piece on the Bush-Kerry showdown of 2004. In between is Thompson&#x2019;s remarkable coverage of the 1972 presidential campaign and plenty of attention paid to Richard Nixon; encounters with Muhammad Ali, Bill Clinton, and the Super Bowl; and a lengthy excerpt from his acknowledged masterpiece, <i>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</i>. The definitive volume of Hunter S.

Thompson was born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky. His books include <i>Hell's Angels</i>, <i>Fear and Loathing at Rolling Stone</i>, <i>Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72</i>, <i>The Rum Diary</i>, and <i>Better than Sex</i>. He died in February 2005.<p> <b><b>Introduction</b><br>Paul Scanlon</b> </p><p>When I first met Hunter S. Thompson in 1971, I didn&#x2019;t know what to expect. I was familiar with his work, of course, and had read the wonderful account of his campaign to become sheriff of Pitkin County (Aspen), Colorado, in the pages of <i>Rolling Stone</i>. He had been in Los Angeles working on a piece about the murder of newspaperman Ruben Salazar. There had been talk&#x2014;very vague talk&#x2014;about his writing something about Las Vegas. Then, one fine spring day, he appeared in <i>Rolling Stone</i>&#x2019;s San Francisco office. For me, and the magazine, nothing would ever be quite the same. </p><p>If you were a progressively minded college student in the 1960s, certain books were required reading: <i>One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x2019;s Nest</i> by Ken Kesey, <i>A Confederate General from Big Sur</i> and <i>Trout Fishing in America</i> by Richard Brautigan, <i>The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby</i> and <i>The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test</i> by Tom Wolfe, and <i>Hell&#x2019;s Angels</i> by Hunter S. Thompson. </p><p>As an undergraduate majoring in journalism, I was drawn to the writing of Wolfe and a few others who were practicing what was not yet being called the &#x201c;New Journalism.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s funny, but even at an �berliberal school like San Francisco State, there was a schism&#x2014;what was known in the day as a &#x201c;generation gap&#x201d;&#x2014;between faculty and students over this new kind of writing. Our professors considered Wolfe and his ilk poseurs, inspiring some kind of journalistic vaudeville by applying fictional techniques to reporting. We thought our instructors intended to mold us into drones, destined to carve out careers at small-town dailies. </p><p>I guess it was my junior year when I pulled a copy of <i>The Nation</i> from the student lounge magazine rack and had my first encounter with the writing of Hunter Thompson. It was the first of his two-part report on traveling with the Hells Angels. The outlaw motorcycle club&#x2019;s Oakland chapter was a fixture in the Bay Area. Encountering a group of Angels was not uncommon, especially after they embraced LSD and began hanging out at dance-rock concerts in places like the Fillmore Auditorium and Winterland. Big Brother and the Holding Company became their &#x201c;official&#x201d; band. The rule of thumb was simple if you were nearby: keep your distance and try not to make eye contact. Even in their brief, acid-drenched benign phase, the Angels were downright scary, clearly capable of unpredictable violence. </p><p>So it was a revelation to me that there was a writer who could figure out a way to win their trust and run with these characters. Hunter Thompson clearly had the smarts and the courage to do so. Or he was a hell of a salesman and a little bit crazy. Whatever. That early installment in <i>The Nation</i> convinced me he was the real deal. Later that day, I wondered aloud to my fellow campus newspaper staffers what our faculty advisers would make of <i>him.</i> </p><p><i>Rolling Stone</i> in the early 1970s was an exciting place to be. Social, cultural, and political unrest was in the air and we tried to cover that turbulence in ways that newspapers and newsweeklies did not. I was the managing editor for many of those years and was fortunate to work with some of the finest journalists in the land, including several on the magazine&#x2019;s masthead. My colleagues were a gifted bunch of renegades who had served apprenticeships in places like the <i>Los Angeles Times,</i> the <i>New York Post,</i> the <i>Detroit Free Press,</i> the <i>Cleveland Plain Dealer,</i> and the <i>Wall Street Journal.</i> Two of our most talented staffers came from the creative writing programs of San Francisco State and Stanford. Our first copy chief, who kept the place from coming unglued every two-week publishing cycle, was a Middle East scholar who had once roomed with Owsley Stanley III. We all shared a disdain for traditional, mainstream journalism and a penchant for hard work. </p><p>When Hunter entered our ranks he quickly became, in many ways, our team leader. He had already established his credentials as an outlaw journalist, and the Salazar piece would demonstrate his investigative zeal. </p><p>You had to like the guy. I think some of it came from his innate Southern charm and the contradictory fact that he was, well, a little shy. He was in town that spring to work on &#x201c;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Part I,&#x201d; and had set up shop in the basement of Jann Wenner&#x2019;s house. His visits to the office, a converted downtown warehouse with lots of exposed brick and wooden beams, were infrequent, but always memorable. Hunter was a big, hulking but graceful guy who clearly had charisma, and we responded to it. </p><p>Standing about six-foot-two, usually clad in khaki shorts, high-topped sneakers, a baseball cap, and either a parka or a safari jacket, he&#x2019;d amble into the office with a bowlegged quickstep, making the zigzagging, seriocomic, dramatic entrance we had come to expect. There was a big, round oak table in the middle of the editorial department, a sort of central gathering spot, where he&#x2019;d plop down his leather rucksack, open it, and wordlessly proceed to remove the contents, which varied, but usually included something edible, like a grapefruit, a carton of Dunhills, a large police flashlight, a bottle of Wild Turkey, and a can of liquid Mace. </p><p>Next, he&#x2019;d open his mouth and speak. I called it &#x201c;Hunter-ese.&#x201d; His delivery was something akin to a lawn sprinkler or a Gatling gun, a rapid-fire baritone mumble that was hard to understand at first. But once you caught on to the rhythms, you realized he was spitting out perfect sentences. </p><p>Late one morning, Hunter came in and handed some manuscript pages to a couple of editors and me, then turned and motored out with nary a word. He had given us copies of the first section of &#x201c;Vegas,&#x201d; and by late afternoon most of the staff had read and digested them. We were flat knocked out. Between fits of laughter we ran our favorite lines back and forth to one another: &#x201c;One toke? You poor fool. Wait until you see those goddamned bats!&#x201d; Delivered in Hunter-ese, of course. </p><p>Between bouts of serious writing there was the usual goofing off and troublemaking. There were evenings of drug-fueled adventures that left more than a few staffers dazed and worn out. There were interesting characters who were part of his&#x2014;and subsequently our&#x2014;orbit, including Oscar Zeta Acosta, who was the model for the &#x201c;three-hundred-pound Samoan attorney&#x201d; in &#x201c;Vegas,&#x201d; and his sometimes sidekick, a fellow named Savage Henry. </p><p>Early on we became familiar with Hunter&#x2019;s penchant for fright wigs, bizarre recordings of animals in their death throes that would somehow find their way onto the office public address system, and novelty store pranks. One evening Jann invited a few of us over to his place on some pretext or other. We walked in and saw Hunter standing there in a torn tie-dyed T-shirt covered in red splotches. Brandishing what looked like a giant horse syringe, he announced that he was going to inject 151 proof rum directly into his navel. He then jammed the &#x201c;needle&#x201d; into his belly and doubled over as he let out a series of wails and groans. One of my companions almost fainted. </p><p>But the fun and games&#x2014;for Hunter and for the rest of us&#x2014;always took second position to the work. We loved what we were doing, and none more than he. Once, reflecting on the scrambling years of his early career, he stated that he had &#x201c;no taste for either poverty or honest labor, so writing is the only recourse left for me.&#x201d; His tongue, of course, was firmly in his cheek. He was serious about his craft and was an ongoing student of correct grammar and syntax, and enjoyed sharing that knowledge. One of our staff writers was quite talented but often taunted for the sloppiness of his copy. I stood by one day as Hunter patiently lectured him on the necessity of producing a clean manuscript and how it would complement his writing skills (Hunter was right). In fact, he went out of his way to be friendly and helpful, even solicitous, about our work. Hunter would somehow get wind of what I was assigning and often I&#x2019;d find on my desk a note in his distinctive scrawl suggesting a source or a contact. The notes were always signed: OK/HST. He had a gift to inspire, and he lifted everybody&#x2019;s game. </p><p>He could have played the star, but the really good ones never do. <i>Hells Angels</i> brought notoriety, and his Kentucky Derby piece for <i>Scanlan&#x2019;s</i> as well as the early <i>Rolling Stone</i> appearances received attention. He chose to be a friend and colleague, and we responded in kind. When the sloppy manuscript guy heard that Hunter used swimming as a way to relax, he escorted Hunter to a scuba school a couple of blocks away where he could do laps when the pool was free. </p><p>When he was in town, Hunter became a low-key regular at Jerry&#x2019;s Inn, the staff watering hole across the street. He was very much at home there at the bar, and would love to engage us, one-on-one, in everything from his heroes, Scott Fitzgerald and Joseph Conrad; to classic sportswriters such as Jimmy Cannon or Red Smith; to the fortunes of the Oakland Raiders, the scruffy, mean-spirited pro football team on which he had a few friends. He also loved to talk shop, about articles we would read in <i>Esquire</i> and elsewhere, which I like to think validated a few of the hours we spent in Jerry&#x2019;s instead of in the office. </p><p>When Hunter embarked on the 1972 campaign trail, it signaled the end of one chapter and the beginning of another for both him and the magazine. At first there was no real blueprint other than establishing a presence with an office in Washington, D.C. But he quickly found himself reinventing the mission statement almost issue by issue, and pretty soon the assignment had become an endless road trip. He was always writing against extreme deadline and filing copy at the last possi...</p></p><h2>Dory Fantasmagory: Tiny Tough</h2><p><b>The fifth adventure in the enormously popular Dory Fantasmagory series takes on the tried-and-true theme of childhood friendships, and turns it on its head, Dory-style.</b><br><br>When her big sister Violet has friend trouble at school, Dory tries to come to her rescue.

Because I&#x2019;m never busy. Today my mom says we are going to the library. &#x201c;Yay!&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;I can check out new books!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I love our afternoons together,&#x201d; says my mom. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re my little partner.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;So that means you like me the best, right?&#x201d; I ask.&nbsp;</p><p>She winks at me and says, &#x201c;Nope.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At the library, I go straight to the big desk and ask the librarian, &#x201c;You know that book about a family who eats breakfast in the shower and the mom wears a dress that&#x2019;s made out of live chickens?&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;And the boy eats with his feet and then the lights go off and they think they&#x2019;re dead but then their cat and dog turn on the electricity.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Rascal, are you making this up?&#x201d; asks my mom.</p><p>&#x201c;No!

After seven books she says, &#x201c;Rascal, I&#x2019;m going to the bathroom. I want you to read quietly while I&#x2019;m gone, okay?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t read.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, you can,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be right back.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>A very short kid wearing a dinosaur tail starts talking to me.

But I have a monster and a fairy godmother who help me fight Mrs. Gobble Gracker. My monster sleeps under my bed. Her name is Mary, she is my best friend. And my fairy godmother is named Mr. Nuggy and he can do magic. He lives in the trees and he has a big mustache, and once, a long time ago,&nbsp;he turned into a chicken. If I have an emergency, I can call him for help. I can call him from a banana.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>They have a lot of questions.&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;SSHhhh!!! Be quiet, everybody! Mrs. Wobba Wacka woke up behind the couch!&#x201d; says the girl with the dinosaur tail.</p><p>&#x201c;What are you talking about? She sleeps in her cave!&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;And it&#x2019;s far away.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She wants bweakfast!&#x201d; she says.</p><p>&#x201c;Quick, we gotta make it!&#x201d; says another kid.&nbsp;</p><p>Then all the kids start making breakfast no matter what I say.</p><p>&#x201c;If we don&#x2019;t make it faster, she&#x2019;ll throw bones at us,&#x201d; says one kid.</p><p>&#x201c;I just saw a flying bone!&#x201d; says another kid. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s coming!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh no!&#x201d; says a kid, diving into the couch.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, you better have coffee,&#x201d; I warn them. &#x201c;Mrs. Gobble Gracker drinks a lot of coffee in the morning.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;NO! She drinks <i>sauce</i>! Not coffee!&#x201d; says a little boy.&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Bone sauce!&#x201d; says the kid from inside the couch.&nbsp;</p><p>Then everyone hides from Mrs. Gobble Gracker.&nbsp;</p><p>Uh-oh. I see my mom coming back from the bathroom. I grab a book and pretend to read quietly.</p><p>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s it going?&#x201d; asks my mom.</p><p>The kid pops out of the couch.&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Dory&#x2014;say good-bye. We&#x2019;re leaving,&#x201d; says my mom.</p><p>&#x201c;But I didn&#x2019;t check out any books!&#x201d; I say.</p><p>&#x201c;I know, but I asked you to read quietly,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;And instead you&#x2019;ve made all these kids savages.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s a savage?&#x201d; I ask. My mom doesn&#x2019;t answer, she just walks quickly to the door. &#x201c;Does it have something to do with pirates?&#x201d; I ask her.&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry about the disruption,&#x201d; says my mom to the librarian.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On the way home, my mom says, &#x201c;Rascal, I was thinking, well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you know how you outgrow things when you get older, like your shoes? Well, you might outgrow <i>other things</i> too, like&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. say&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. your Mrs. Gobble Gracker game, for example.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not outgrowing them,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;My shoes are shrinking.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, they&#x2019;re not,&#x201d; says my mom.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, they are!&#x201d; I say.</p><p>&#x201c;No, they&#x2019;re not,&#x201d; says my mom.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, they are!&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You know, I just thought of something,&#x201d; says my mom, trying to change the subject. &#x201c;What if we got you a new toy, <i>something really special</i>. Something that you might play with a lot, that might be even more fun than&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. your Mrs. Gobble Gracker game.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Like a bribe?&#x201d; I ask.</p><p>&#x201c;Wha&#x2014;no&#x2014; Rascal! I would never&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, I know what I want.&#x201d;</p><p>My mom looks happy. &#x201c;What is it, honey?&#x201d; she asks.</p><p>&#x201c;TUBTOWN! I saw a picture of it in a maga�zine at Grandma&#x2019;s house. It&#x2019;s a town that sticks to the bathtub. It has suction cups that make it stick! It has an elevator! And a shower! And a fish and chips shop, and a lighthouse and a pool with a diving board and a little raft that the people can go in and float around the bathtub and&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Rascal, we already talked about this. That was a very old magazine. <i>You know how Grandma doesn&#x2019;t throw anything out</i>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<i> </i>The company doesn&#x2019;t make that toy anymore. I can&#x2019;t buy it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But that&#x2019;s impossible! They would never stop making <i>the best toy in the world</i>!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, they did,&#x201d; says my mom. &#x201c;I already tried to buy it. It doesn&#x2019;t exist anymore.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Does this have something to do with pirates?&#x201d; I ask.</p><p>&#x201c;Rascal&#x2014;<i>did you understand anything I just said</i>?&#x201d; asks my mom.&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;When I get TubTown, I&#x2019;m going to take a bath every single day. I&#x2019;m going to smell clean as a dishwasher!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Rascal, can you be quiet now, I have to help Luke,&#x201d; says my mom.&nbsp;</p><p>Then she says a bunch of math stuff to Luke. Luke gets mad.</p><p>&#x201c;I already know how to solve it!&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re interrupting me. I already did that step!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And I&#x2019;m going to pretend that the little people in TubTown are all kids and they never grow up!&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Luke, the answer can&#x2019;t be 64,&#x201d; says my mom. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not right.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes it is!&#x201d; says Luke.</p><p>&#x201c;And they do backflips off the diving board,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;And they go head first down the slide into the ocean and they play in the waves all day!&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Think about it,&#x201d; my mom says to Luke. &#x201c;She can&#x2019;t have more cupcakes than she started with. You need to subtract. Can you just listen for one second&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Luke wails, &#x201c;First I added&#x2014;<i>THEN</i> I subtracted!&#x201d;</p><p>Violet comes in the kitchen. &#x201c;Mom, I need to talk to you.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Can you wait?&#x201d; she asks Violet.</p><p>&#x201c;No, I can&#x2019;t! I got in a huge fight with Anna today. She made friendship bracelets and she didn&#x2019;t make me one. But then I found one on my desk, and I thought she made it for me, so I put it on and she said that I stole it.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;A stolen bracelet?&#x201d; I say, astonished. &#x201c;Is it pure gold?&#x201d; I ask.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s string. <i>Be quiet, Rascal!&#x201d; </i>says Violet.</p><p>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s the thief?&#x201d; I ask.</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no thief, Rascal,&#x201d; says my mom.</p><p><i>&#x201c;</i>Anna said she put it on the wrong desk&#x2014;since everyone in my class just switched desks, she got confused,&#x201d; says Violet. &#x201c;So, I told her she could have it back, but I couldn&#x2019;t get the string untied. When I finally got the string untied I was in the bathroom, so I put it in my pocket. When I got back to the classroom, it wasn&#x2019;t in my pocket! I told her I lost it, and she was really mad and didn&#x2019;t believe me.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p><i>&#x201c;A lost treasure?&#x201d;</i> I ask. &#x201c;Does this have something to do with pirates?&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p><i>&#x201c;Why on earth do you keep asking that?</i>&#x201d; yells my mom.</p><p>&#x201c;Shush, Rascal!&#x201d; says Violet.</p><p>&#x201c;But I don&#x2019;t understand why Anna wouldn&#x2019;t make you a bracelet in the first place. She&#x2019;s your best friend!&#x201d; says my mom.</p><p>&#x201c;She said I was being bossy. But she&#x2019;s bossy too!&#x201d; says Violet.</p><p>I grab a weapon.&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Put the broom down!&#x201d; says my mom. &#x201c;Come on, let&#x2019;s move away from Rascal.&#x201d; She leaves the kitchen with her arm around Violet.&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I can help you with your homework,&#x201d; I tell Luke.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, right,&#x201d; he says.&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Just listen,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;If you have 64 cupcakes and you have 6 bags of pancakes, but if you sit on one bag of pancakes and 4 toucans go to the bathroom on your backpack, then how many bags of pancakes would you&#x2014;&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>My mom rushes back into the kitchen with Violet trailing behind her. &#x201c;Rascal, what happened? <i>Luke! </i>What did you do to her?<i>&#x201d;</i></p><p>&#x201c;He flunjed me!&#x201d; I cry.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not even a word,&#x201d; says Luke. &#x201c;She was teasing me about my math.

In <i>Homeric Moments</i>, she brilliantly conveys the unique delights of Homer's epics as she focuses on the crucial scenes, or moments, that mark the high points of the narratives: Penelope and Odysseus, faithful wife and returning husband, sit face to face at their own hearth for the first time in twenty years; young Telemachus, with his father Odysseus at his side, boldly confronts the angry suitors; Achilles gives way to boundless grief at the death of his friend Patroclus.</p><p>Eva Brann demonstrates a way of reading Homer's poems that yields up their hidden treasures. With an alert eye for Homer's extraordinary visual effects and a keen ear for the musicality of his language, she helps the reader see the flickering campfires of the Greeks and hear the roar of the surf and the singing of nymphs. In <i>Homeric Moments</i>, Brann takes readers beneath the captivating surface of the poems to explore the inner connections and layers of meaning that have made the epics "the marvel of the ages."</p><p>"Written with wit and clarity, this book will be of value to those reading the <i>Odyssey</i> and the <i>Iliad</i> for the first time and to those teaching it to beginners." <i>Library Journal</i></p><p>"<i>Homeric Moments</i> is a feast for the mind and the imagination, laid out in clear and delicious prose. With Brann, old friends of Homer and new acquaintances alike will rejoice in the beauty, and above all the humanity, of the epics." Jacob Howland, University of Tulsa, Author of <i>The Paradox of Political Philosophy</i></p><p>"In&nbsp;<i>Homeric Moments</i>, Eva Brann lovingly leads us, as she has surely led countless students, through the gallery of delights that is Homer's poetry. Brann's enthusiasm is as infectious as her deep familiarity with the works is illuminating." Rachel Hadas</p><p>"Brann invites us to enter a conversation [about Homer] in which information and formal arguments jostle with appreciations and frank conjectures and surmises to increase our pleasure and deepen the inward dimension of our humanity." Richard Freis, Millsaps College</p><p>"For anyone eager to experience the profundity and charm of Homer's great epic poems, Eva Brann's book will serve as a passionate and engaging guide. Brann displays a deep sensitivity to the cadence and flow of Homeric poetry, and the kind of knowing intimacy with its characters that comes from years of teaching and contemplation. Her relaxed but informative approach succeeds in conveying the grandeur of the great Homeric heroes, while making them continually resonate for our own lives. Brann helps us see that this poetry has an urgency for our own era as much as it did for a distant past." Ralph M. Rosen, University of Pennsylvania, Author of&nbsp;<i>Old Comedy</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Iambographic Tradition</i></p><p>"The most enjoyable books about Homer are always written by those who have read and taught him the most. Eva Brann's collection of astute observations, unusual asides, and visual snapshots of the&nbsp;<i>Iliad</i>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<i>Odyssey</i>&nbsp;reveals a lifelong friendship with the poet, and is as pleasurable as it is informative.&nbsp;<i>Homeric Moments</i>&nbsp;is rare erudition without pedantry, in a tone marked by good sense without levity." Victor Davis Hanson, author of&nbsp;<i>The Other Greeks</i>&nbsp;and co-author of&nbsp;<i>Who Killed Homer?</i></p><p><b>Eva Brann</b> is a member of the senior faculty at St. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland, where she has taught for fifty years.

Brann holds an M.A. in Classics and a Ph.D. in Archaeology from Yale University. Her recent books include The Ways of Naysaying; What, Then, Is Time?; and The World of the Imagination. A volume of her selected essays, The Past-Present, was published in 1997.We might all wish that philosopher and classicist Brann had taught us Homer. Falling short of that, we can read Homeric Moments, a study of Homer's epics, the Odyssey and the Iliad, based on Brann's 40-year teaching experience at St. John's College in Annapolis, MD. Eschewing issues of contemporary theory or the technical concerns of classical philology, Brann instead focuses on a close reading of Homer's narrative and characters, with a concern for what makes them enduring and insightful. She draws attention to Homer's language, exploring the layers of verbal connotation, and she is especially interested in how Homer creates "delight," a pleasure that appeals to the senses and comes from the extended action and inward refiguring of the events narrated. Brann then contrasts this with the more intense pleasure of tragedy, where the purification of passions induces a more thoughtful response. Written with wit and clarity, this book will be of value both to those reading the Odyssey and the Iliad for the first time and to those teaching it to beginners.

E. M. Forster's famous description of C. P. Cavafy--the most widely known and best loved modern Greek poet--perfectly captures the unique perspective Cavafy brought to bear on history and geography, sexuality and language. Cavafy wrote about people on the periphery, whose religious, ethnic and cultural identities are blurred, and he was one of the pioneers in expressing a specifically homosexual sensibility. His poems present brief and vivid evocations of historical scenes and sensual moments, often infused with his distinctive sense of irony. They have established him as one of the most important poets of the twentieth century. The only bilingual edition of Cavafy's collected poems currently available, this volume presents the most authentic Greek text of every poem he ever published, together with a new English translation that beautifully conveys the accent and rhythm of Cavafy's individual tone of voice. In addition, the volume includes an extensive introduction by Peter Mackridge, explanatory notes that gloss Greek historical names and events alluded to in the poems, a chronological list of the poems, and indexes of Greek and English titles.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

She won the Man Booker International Prize in 2013.THE COLLECTED STORIES OF LYDIA DAVIS &nbsp; Story <p>I get home from work and there is a message from him: that he is not coming, that he is busy. He will call again. I wait to hear from him, then at nine o&#x2019;clock I go to where he lives, find his car, but he&#x2019;s not home. I knock at his apartment door and then at all the garage doors, not knowing which garage door is his&#x2014;no answer. I write a note, read it over, write a new note, and stick it in his door. At home I am restless, and all I can do, though I have a lot to do, since I&#x2019;m going on a trip in the morning, is play the piano. I call again at ten forty-five and he&#x2019;s home, he has been to the movies with his old girlfriend, and she&#x2019;s still there. He says he&#x2019;ll call back. I wait. Finally I sit down and write in my notebook that when he calls me either he will then come to me, or he will not and I will be angry, and so I will have either him or my own anger, and this might be all right, since anger is always a great comfort, as I found with my husband. And then I go on to write, in the third person and the past tense, that clearly she always needed to have a love even if it was a complicated love. He calls back before I have time to finish writing all this down. When he calls, it is a little after eleven thirty. We argue until nearly twelve. Everything he says is a contradiction: for example, he says he did not want to see me because he wanted to work and even more because he wanted to be alone, but he has not worked and he has not been alone. There is no way I can get him to reconcile any of his contradictions, and when this conversation begins to sound too much like many I had with my husband I say goodbye and hang up. I finish writing down what I started to write down even though by now it no longer seems true that anger is any great comfort.</p> <p>I call him back five minutes later to tell him that I am sorry about all this arguing, and that I love him, but there is no answer. I call again five minutes later, thinking he might have walked out to his garage and walked back, but again there is no answer. I think of driving to where he lives again and looking for his garage to see if he is in there working, because he keeps his desk there and his books and that is where he goes to read and write. I am in my nightgown, it is after twelve and I have to leave the next morning at five. Even so, I get dressed and drive the mile or so to his place. I am afraid that when I get there I will see other cars by his house that I did not see earlier and that one of them will belong to his old girlfriend. When I drive down the driveway I see two cars that weren&#x2019;t there before, and one of them is parked as close as possible to his door, and I think that she is there. I walk around the small building to the back where his apartment is, and look in the window: the light is on, but I can&#x2019;t see anything clearly because of the half-closed venetian blinds and the steam on the glass. But things inside the room are not the same as they were earlier in the evening, and before there was no steam. I open the outer screen door and knock. I wait. No answer. I let the screen door fall shut and I walk away to check the row of garages. Now the door opens behind me as I am walking away and he comes out. I can&#x2019;t see him very well because it is dark in the narrow lane beside his door and he is wearing dark clothes and whatever light there is is behind him. He comes up to me and puts his arms around me without speaking, and I think he is not speaking not because he is feeling so much but because he is preparing what he will say. He lets go of me and walks around me and ahead of me out to where the cars are parked by the garage doors.</p> <p>As we walk out there he says &#x201c;Look,&#x201d; and my name, and I am waiting for him to say that she is here and also that it&#x2019;s all over between us. But he doesn&#x2019;t, and I have the feeling he did intend to say something like that, at least say that she was here, and that he then thought better of it for some reason. Instead, he says that everything that went wrong tonight was his fault and he&#x2019;s sorry. He stands with his back against a garage door and his face in the light and I stand in front of him with my back to the light. At one point he hugs me so suddenly that the fire of my cigarette crumbles against the garage door behind him. I know why we&#x2019;re out here and not in his room, but I don&#x2019;t ask him until everything is all right between us. Then he says, &#x201c;She wasn&#x2019;t here when I called you. She came back later.&#x201d; He says the only reason she is there is that something is troubling her and he is the only one she can talk to about it. Then he says, &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t understand, do you?&#x201d;</p> <p>I try to figure it out.</p> <p>So they went to the movies and then came back to his place and then I called and then she left and he called back and we argued and then I called back twice but he had gone out to get a beer (he says) and then I drove over and in the meantime he had returned from buying beer and she had also come back and she was in his room so we talked by the garage doors. But what is the truth? Could he and she both really have come back in that short interval between my last phone call and my arrival at his place? Or is the truth really that during his call to me she waited outside or in his garage or in her car and that he then brought her in again, and that when the phone rang with my second and third calls he let it ring without answering, because he was fed up with me and with arguing? Or is the truth that she did leave and did come back later but that he remained and let the phone ring without answering? Or did he perhaps bring her in and then go out for the beer while she waited there and listened to the phone ring? The last is the least likely. I don&#x2019;t believe anyway that there was any trip out for beer.</p> <p>The fact that he does not tell me the truth all the time makes me not sure of his truth at certain times, and then I work to figure out for myself if what he is telling me is the truth or not, and sometimes I can figure out that it&#x2019;s not the truth and sometimes I don&#x2019;t know and never know, and sometimes just because he says it to me over and over again I am convinced it is the truth because I don&#x2019;t believe he would repeat a lie so often. Maybe the truth does not matter, but I want to know it if only so that I can come to some conclusions about such questions as: whether he is angry at me or not; if he is, then how angry; whether he still loves her or not; if he does, then how much; whether he loves me or not; how much; how capable he is of deceiving me in the act and after the act in the telling.</p> <p>THE COLLECTED STORIES OF LYDIA DAVIS Copyright � 2009 by Lydia Davis</p></p><h2>On Being Blue: A Philosophical Inquiry (New York Review Books (Paperback))</h2><p><i>On Being Blue</i> is a book about everything blue&#x2014;sex and sleaze and sadness, among other things&#x2014;and about everything else.

Although green enlivens the earth and mixes in the ocean, and we find it, copperish, in fire; green air, green skies, are rare. Gray and brown are widely distributed, but there are no joyful swatches of either, or any of exuberant black, sullen pink, or acquiescent orange. Blue is therefore most suitable as the color of interior life. Whether slick light sharp high bright thin quick sour new and cool or low deep sweet dark soft slow smooth heavy old and warm: blue moves easily among them all, and all profoundly qualify our states of feeling.</p><p>In this, one of the strangest books about writing and language you&#39;re likely ever to read, fiction writer and philosophy professor Gass spins off into an improvisational inquiry into the nature of words and consciousness, using as his departure point the concept of the color blue--the idea of blue, the state of blue, the uses of blue...the bluenesses of blue. It&#39;s kind of hard to sum up, and if it sounds weird, it is--but it&#39;s also wonderful.Of the colors, blue and green have the greatest emotional range.

He paused, clutching the door handle, cursing his body for recalling so quickly what he&#x2019;d worked long years to forget.<br><br>Logic caught up to his racing pulse, reining it in. The dim glow of banked coals cast ominous shadows, but Jeremy forced the room into focus. This was not that night. He was in his usual bedchamber at Waltham Manor, not wandering Corbinsdale Woods. More than twenty years had passed, and he was no longer a boy. Whatever surprise awaited him on the other side of the door, he was fully equipped to face it.<br><br>When he slid back the rusted bolt and wrenched open the door, Jeremy was prepared for the worst.<br><br>&#x201c;Hold still,&#x201d; came the whispered command.<br><br>He had an instant to register a feminine silhouette, a tangle of dark curls, and two hands grasping his shoulders. Then Lucy Waltham, the younger sister of his oldest friend, popped up on her toes and pressed her lips to his with such force, he stumbled against the doorjamb.<br><br>Good Lord. The girl was kissing him.<br><br>Well, he thought ironically, he&#x2019;d been prepared for the worst. And of the many kisses Jeremy Trescott had experienced in his nine-and-twenty years, this was, undoubtedly, the worst.<br><br>Lucy kissed with her lips perfectly puckered and her eyes open wide. And if she lacked in finesse, she compensated with bold enthusiasm. Her hands were everywhere at once&#x2014;tangling in his hair, skimming his shoulders, exploring the broad expanse of his chest.<br><br>This wasn&#x2019;t a kiss. It was a siege.<br><br>Furthermore, it was incomprehensible, wholly illogical, and a dozen different shades of wrong.<br><br>Somehow Jeremy&#x2019;s hands found their way to her elbows, and he wrested himself from her eager embrace. &#x201c;Lucy! What the devil do you think you&#x2019;re doing?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Shhhh.&#x201d; Her eyes darted to either side, scanning the darkened corridor. Then her gaze tilted back up to his, narrowing with a disturbing intensity, and Jeremy fancied briefly&#x2014;absurdly&#x2014;that someone had painted a target on his face.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m practicing,&#x201d; she whispered, her fingers tightening over his arms. &#x201c;Let me try one more time.&#x201d;<br><br>She swooped up for another kiss, and he instinctively ducked, pulling her into the room and shutting the door behind them. In a more rational moment, it might have occurred to him that the impropriety of kissing his host&#x2019;s sister in the corridor would only be compounded by yanking her into his bedchamber. But Jeremy&#x2019;s faculties of reason had temporarily vacated Waltham Manor.<br><br>Lucy had, quite literally, kissed him witless.<br><br>&#x201c;Did it work, then?&#x201d;<br><br>He stared at her, mute with confusion. Did what work? At the moment, it seemed that nothing worked, least of all his brain. Shock had frozen his limbs. He certainly couldn&#x2019;t force an answer from his lips.<br><br>Stepping back, she crossed her arms over her crimson velvet dressing gown and surveyed his form boldly. As her gaze traveled downward, Jeremy grew uncomfortably aware of his own dishabille, from nightshirt to worn breeches to bare feet.<br><br>A satisfied smile spread across her face. &#x201c;It must have worked. You did pull me into your bedchamber.&#x201d; She reached for the door handle. &#x201c;Very well, Jemmy. I suppose that&#x2019;s enough practice. I&#x2019;ll see you at breakfast.&#x201d;<br><br>She cracked open the door. Jeremy put out a hand and slammed it shut.<br><br>Shooting him a glare, she grasped the handle with both hands and tugged. &#x201c;I beg your pardon. I&#x2019;ll be on my way, then.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, you won&#x2019;t.&#x201d; He leaned his weight on the door, effectively bolting it closed. Lucy might be used to flouting her brother&#x2019;s half-hearted attempts at guardianship, but Jeremy had four inches and two stone on Henry Waltham, not to mention an iron will. Lucy did not walk all over him.<br><br>He mustered his most autocratic, Earl-of-Kendall tone. &#x201c;You are not going anywhere. You&#x2019;re going to sit down and explain yourself.&#x201d; She opened her mouth to object. He grabbed her by the elbow and steered her toward a chair. &#x201c;But first,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I am going to have a drink.&#x201d;<br><br>She stopped struggling under his grip and dropped gracelessly into the chair. &#x201c;A drink,&#x201d; she repeated. &#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t I think of that? A drink would be just the thing, thank you.&#x201d;<br><br>Shaking his head, Jeremy strode to the bar and poured a single glass of whiskey. He downed half the liquor in one greedy swallow, closing his eyes to savor the burn spreading down his throat. When he opened them again, he looked around to assure himself this was, indeed, the same Waltham Manor he&#x2019;d been visiting each autumn since Cambridge. Roughhewn beams scored the sloping ceiling. Muted tapestries covered the walls, and an unfussy, timeworn carpet obliged his bare feet. The room had not altered in the past eight years, any more than it likely had in the past one hundred.<br><br>In decor, in landscape, in the quartet of old friends enjoying their annual sporting holiday&#x2014;Waltham Manor had remained a welcome constant in Jeremy&#x2019;s life. Until this year, when everything had changed.<br><br>&#x201c;Why couldn&#x2019;t everything just go on as it was?&#x201d; Lucy stirred the fire with a poker, sending swirls of agitated sparks into the air. &#x201c;Why did Felix have to go and get married? He&#x2019;s ruined everything.&#x201d;<br><br>Jeremy drowned his reply with a sip of his drink. He would not have admitted it, but he rather agreed.<br><br>&#x201c;It was all right when Henry got married,&#x201d; she continued. &#x201c;Marianne&#x2019;s so busy with the children, at least she stays out of the way. But that shrew Felix married is going to expect to be entertained. And to make it all worse, she&#x2019;s brought along her sister, that Sophia.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mrs. Crowley-Cumberbatch and Miss Hathaway are, by all accounts, charming young ladies. One would think you&#x2019;d be glad of their company.&#x201d;<br><br>She threw him an incredulous look.<br><br>&#x201c;Or not.&#x201d; Truth be told, Jeremy wasn&#x2019;t glad of their presence, either. There was nothing precisely offensive about Felix&#x2019;s wife, Kitty, or her sister, Sophia. To the contrary, Sophia Hathaway was the epitome of an inoffensive, well-bred society beauty. A bit of meringue&#x2014; insubstantial, but pleasing enough, if one&#x2019;s tastes ran to sweet. As Toby&#x2019;s apparently did.<br><br>Jeremy tossed back another swallow of whiskey and tasted the irony. Henry and Felix married, Toby on the verge . . . their bachelor&#x2019;s retreat had become a family house party. Well, if all his friends were determined to shackle themselves in marriage, at least he would be in no imminent danger of joining them. All three ladies at Waltham Manor were safely accounted for.<br><br>The sound of fingers drumming wood interrupted his thoughts. &#x201c;Do you intend to drink the whole bottle yourself?&#x201d;<br><br>Unless, of course, one counted Lucy.<br><br>And he did not count Lucy. She was neither eligible nor a lady. She was Henry&#x2019;s much younger sister and ward, and she was Jeremy&#x2019;s personal version of a biblical plague. She&#x2019;d spent years devising ways to get under his skin. Now she was charging into his bedchamber and . . . and practicing.<br><br>Much as he wished to erase that kiss from his memory, he couldn&#x2019;t ignore it. Neither could he ignore the obvious implications of that word, &#x201c;practicing.&#x201d;<br><br>He could, however, ignore her request for a drink. Jer?emy refilled his own glass and carried it toward the hearth, dropping into the chair opposite hers. Raking a hand through his hair, he exhaled slowly. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like to ask this. I dread your response. But for what, exactly, are you practicing?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not &#x2018;what,&#x2019;?&#x201d; she answered. &#x201c;Who.&#x201d;<br><br>Oh, it only got worse. &#x201c;For whom are you practicing, then? Some local youth? The vicar&#x2019;s boy?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;For Toby, of course.&#x201d;<br><br>He gave a wry laugh. &#x201c;For Toby? Why would you be kissing Toby? He&#x2019;s all but engaged to Miss Hathaway.&#x201d;<br><br>She hugged her knees to her chest, curling into a ball of red velvet and chestnut curls. The chair&#x2019;s masculine proportions dwarfed her, and her green eyes brimmed with raw, undisguised hurt. &#x201c;Then it&#x2019;s true.&#x201d;<br><br>Bloody hell. Suddenly this bizarre nighttime visit made sense. Jeremy punched the arm of his chair. Of all the irretrievably stupid things to say.<br><br>&#x201c;My maid said she heard it from Toby&#x2019;s valet. I didn&#x2019;t want to believe her. I couldn&#x2019;t believe her. But it&#x2019;s true.&#x201d;<br><br>Jeremy had to look away. It was a matter of self-preservation. Lucy&#x2019;s countenance was a collection of pixie features set within a heart-shaped face&#x2014;a face designed to display, unfiltered, every emotion of the heart within. One couldn&#x2019;t look at her without knowing exactly how she was feeling, and Jeremy didn&#x2019;t wish to know how Lucy was feeling. He preferred to keep a respectful distance from even his own emotions.<br><br>&#x201c;How could he?&#x201d; she squeaked.<br><br>Jeremy winced. Lucy sniffed loudly, and he took another slow sip of whiskey. She could not cry, he wanted to remind her. That was the rule&#x2014;Henry&#x2019;s single exercise in authority. He&#x2019;d allowed the chit to run rough?shod over them every autumn, tagging along on their hunting and fishing excursions, parroting their curses, even taking nips off their flasks&#x2014;under one condition. Lucy was not to cry. In eight years, he had never seen her shed a single tear. He prayed she wasn&#x2019;t about to start now. If there was one thing he couldn&#x2019;t abide, it was a crying woman.<br><br>He stole a glance at her. Damn it, her chin was quivering. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not going to start weeping, are you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; Her voice quivered, too.<br><br>Jeremy busied himself adding wood to the fire, stall?ing for time.<br><br>Curse Toby. This was all his fault. He&#x2019;d always made such a pet of the girl. Every autumn, Lucy clung to Toby like a tick on a hound. He baited her hooks and taught her bawdy Latin conjugations. He brought her flowers and wove her crowns of ivy that went straight to her head. His Diana, Toby called her. Goddess of the hunt.</p><h2>The Hole of Tank Girl</h2><p>Bringing together all the classic Hewlett and Martin <i>Tank Girl </i>comics for the first time in this fantastic slipcased edition with additional material including original art, unseen Hewlett pages, a "lost" <i>Tank Girl </i>story, and a brand new <i>Tank Girl </i>cover by artist Jamie Hewlett. <br><br>The core <i>Tank Girl</i> works have been lovingly restored for this major collection, spanning the entire Jamie Hewlett era of <i>Tank Girl</i>.

But these aloneor even togetherare insufficient for a gospel understanding of conversion. For effective biblical mission, Paul G. Hiebert argues, we must add a third element: a change in worldview. Here he offers a comprehensive study of worldviewits philosophy, its history, its characteristics, and the means for understanding it. He then provides a detailed analysis of several worldviews that missionaries must engage today, addressing the impact of each on Christianity and mission. A biblical worldview is outlined for comparison. Finally, Hiebert argues for gospel ministry that seeks to transform people&#39;s worldviews and offers suggestions for how to do so.</p><p>"<i>Transforming Worldviews</i> is, in many respects, the capstone of Paul Hiebert's work. This book provides valuable insights for all people who engage in God's mission in the varied contexts of the world in this century. It is Hiebert at his best. A superb contribution to missiology. A lasting legacy!"--<b>Tite Ti�nou</b>, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School<br><br>"<i>Transforming Worldviews</i> is Hiebert at his best! For the first time, all of his major missiological insights--from set theory in church growth to the flaw of the excluded middle to critical contextualization--are integrated into a single volume. <i>Transforming Worldviews</i>, in which Hiebert wrestles with one of the most difficult concepts for us to understand and explain, is a fitting exclamation point to a career in which some of the most important evangelical missiological thinking of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries was done."--<b>A. Scott Moreau</b>, Wheaton College; editor, <i>Evangelical Missions Quarterly<br><br></i>"Paul's wide-ranging scholarship, profound faith in Jesus Christ, deep insight, creative thinking, and wholehearted commitment to world evangelization are all evident here. Paul is a mentor, teacher, and guide to all of us involved in thinking about the mission of the church. This book is a wonderful example of his stimulating thought. Everyone interested in communicating the gospel among today's multiplicity of cultures will want to listen to what Paul Hiebert says in this book."--<b>Charles Van Engen</b>, Fuller Theological Seminary; founder and president of Latin American Christian Ministries<br><br>"The late Paul Hiebert's work on worldviews is mission anthropology at its best. This book is his final testimony to the centrality of worldview transformation at the heart of biblical conversion. It is an instant classic--clear, readable, useful, and compelling."--<b>Dana L. Robert</b>, Boston University School of Theology<br><br>"If you could pick one missiologist to sort out the tangled nest that surrounds the word/concept 'worldview,' it would be Paul Hiebert. In <i>Transforming Worldviews</i>, Hiebert does not disappoint. Once again he surveys the landscape majestically, explains clearly, and proposes wisely and faithfully."--<b>Terry C. Muck</b>, Asbury Theological Seminary<b>Paul G. Hiebert </b>(1932-2007) was distinguished professor of mission and anthropology at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School and previously taught at Fuller Theological Seminary. He also served as a pastor and missionary to India. He received his PhD from the University of Minnesota and was the author or coauthor of numerous articles and books in the fields of anthropology and missions.</p><h2>Mercy&#39;s Rain</h2><p><p><strong>When your life is built around a father's wrath, how can you trust in the love of Father God?</strong></p> <p>Mercy Roller knows her name is a lie: there has never been any mercy in her young life. Raised by a twisted and abusive father who called himself the Pastor, she was abandoned by the church community that should have stood together to protect her from his evil. Her mother, consumed by her own fear and hate, won't stand her ground to save Mercy either.</p> <p>The Pastor has robbed Mercy of innocence and love, a husband and her child. Not a single person seems capable of standing up to the Pastor's unrestrained evil. So Mercy takes matters into her own hands.</p> <p>Her heart was hardened to love long before she took on the role of judge, jury, and executioner of the Pastor. She just didn't realize the retribution she thought would save her, might turn her into the very thing she hated most.</p> <p>Sent away by her angry and grieving mother, Mercy's path is unclear until she meets a young preacher headed to counsel a pregnant couple. Sure that her calling is to protect the family, Mercy is drawn into a different life on the other side of the mountain where she slowly discovers true righteousness has nothing evil about it--and that there might be room for her own stained and shattered soul to find shelter. . . and even love.</p> <p><em>Mercy's Rain</em> is a remarkable historical novel set in 19th century Appalachia that traces the thorny path from bitterness to forgiveness and reveals the victory and strength that comes from simple faith.</p></p><p>Cindy K.

Although we intuitively resonate with their meaning and value, for most of us, the challenge is how to embody what we know: how to transform these words into a vibrant, living practice. In these times of conflict and uncertainty, this transformation is far more than an abstract ideal; it is an urgent necessity. Peace in the world begins with us. This wonderfully appealing offering from one the most trusted elders of Buddhism in the West is a warm and engaging exploration of the ways we can cultivate and manifest peace as wise and skillful action in the world.<br><br>This charming book is illuminated throughout with lively, joyous, and sometimes even funny citations from a host of contemporary and ancient sources - from the poetry of W.S.

Born in northeastern Tibet in 1935, he was as a toddler recognized as the incarnation of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama and brought to Tibet's capital, Lhasa. In 1950, Mao Zedong's Communist forces made their first incursions into eastern Tibet, shortly after which the young Dalai Lama assumed the political leadership of his country. In 1959, Chinese forces occupied the city, forcing His Holiness to escape to India. There he set up the Tibetan government-in-exile in Dharamsala, working to secure the welfare of the more than 100,000 Tibetan exiles and prevent the destruction of Tibetan culture. In his capacity as a spiritual and political leader, he has traveled to more than sixty-two countries on six continents and met with presidents, popes, and leading scientists to foster dialogue and create a better world. In recognition of his tireless work for the nonviolent liberation of Tibet, the Dalai Lama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989. In 2012, he relinquished political authority in his exile government and turned it over to democratically elected representatives. He is the author of numerous books, including <i>The Good Heart</i>, <i>The Meaning of Life</i>, <i>The World of Tibetan Buddhism</i>, and <i>The Compassionate Life</i>."This small book conveys with clarity and concision some of the spiritual teachings and practices we urgently need to help balance the materialism of our age--compassion, love, kindness, a skillful mind, and a peaceful heart."

VISUAL COMPENSATION<br>While designing, you play a game of perceptual illusion where you aim at creating a steady rhythm of evenness between the various elements of the words. There are a number of tricks you can use to succeed in this process. Yet, for every rule, there is an exception. Depending on the proportion, weight, and stroke contrast of the typeface, what you do will affect the letter shapes in different ways. Consequently, there is no set rule that applies in every situation.

The section provides specific recommendations regarding <i>what</i> and <i>how</i> information is gathered across assessment purposes. The recommendations provided will apply to all of the specified populations of children (<i>children with diverse abilities</i>) unless otherwise specified by one of the following: <i>children with multiple or severe disabilities, children from diverse cultural backgrounds</i>, and <i>children who are dual- or multilanguage learners.</i></p><p><b>What to Assess</b></p><p>When assessing <i>children with multiple or severe disabilities</i>, teachers need to gather information about the general effects of the disability on typical development to support their interpretations of test results (i.e., determine whether a documented delay should be considered an area of need or if the delay is within the typical trajectory for same-age peers with the same disability). For most children with multiple or severe disabilities, the course of development is different, not necessarily slower (Ferrell, 1998). For example, research has shown that children with visual impairments learn things in a different sequence and at a different rate than children who are typically developing. As a general rule, teachers should avoid comparisons between children who are typically developing and children with a disability and should keep in mind that a disability in one area affects a child's abilities or developmental trajectories in other areas. </p><p>Gathering information about the child's use of functional skills is critical when assessing young <i> children with multiple or severe disabilities</i> (Browder, 2001). As previously mentioned, teachers should examine function rather than form. For example, an item that measures ability to get from Point A to Point B is a more appropriate assessment of a child's functioning than an item that focuses on specific locomotor skills, such as walking or running. Children may demonstrate the function of the skill by moving around in a wheelchair, crawling, or using a walker. Likewise, an open-ended item that measures a child's ability to communicate his or her wants and needs is more functional than focusing on specific verbal communication skills, such as speaking or pointing. Therefore, teachers should focus on developing comprehensive descriptions of a child's functioning on tasks or skills considered important to the child's present and future performance (Meisels &amp; Atkins-Burnett, 2000). </p><p>When assessing children from diverse cultural backgrounds or children who are dual- or multilanguage learners, teachers should gather information about the child's culture and language patterns in the home (Espinosa, 2010; Sandall, Hemmeter, Smith, &amp; McLean, 2005). It would be wise to collect information about the child's learning style and experience with materials, the family's preferences and child-rearing practices, as well as what behaviors and ways of approaching adults are culturally appropriate before conducting screening and assessment (California Department of Education, 2007). Furthermore, teachers should determine who in the child's family speaks or understands which languages and for what purposes (e.g., read the newspaper, watch TV, listen to the radio, talk to friends or socialize). Simply determining the language spoken in the home is not enough. Parent surveys or as recommended by the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (Westby, Burda, &amp; Mehta, 2003), ethnographic interviewing, can be used for gathering information regarding the language a child is exposed to, how and when they use various languages, and for gaining a better understanding of the family context and preferences. </p><p>Gathering information about the language patterns in the home can provide insight about the acculturation of the child and family. The term <i>acculturation</i> refers to the process in which members of one cultural group adopt the beliefs, behaviors, language, or cultural traits of another cultural group (Schumann, 1978). Understanding the level of acculturation is important, given that young children who are dual- or multilanguage learners are acquiring not just a new language, but a new culture as well. When children experience culture shock, their academic and social behaviors can appear to mirror those of a student with special needs (Grassi &amp; Barker, 2010). Consider the preschool child who is not expected to feed himself at home. At preschool, food is placed in front of the child with the expectation that he will feed himself. The child might scream, cry, or simply "shut down" out of fear or frustration, not understanding the situation or not being able to perform the task. During the assessment process, teachers might interpret the child's behavior as a number of things that are untrue about the child's abilities (e.g., a fine motor delay, challenging behavior, sensory processing issue). Box 4.3 outlines further examples of behaviors exhibited by dual- or multilanguage learners experiencing culture shock. <b>Behaviors exhibited by dual or multilanguage learners experiencing culture shock</b></p><ul><li>Constantly asking to go to the bathroom or the school nurse </li><li>Crying or exhibiting signs of depression </li><li>Throwing chairs or books across the room </li><li>Being unable to stay focused on tasks </li><li>Falling asleep during class </li><li>Exhibiting outbursts of anger, violence, frustration, or sadness </li><li>Getting into fights at recess </li><li>Leaving the classroom or asking to go home </li><li>Being out sick from school for many days</li></ul> From Grassi, E., &amp; Baker, H.B. [2010]. <i>Culturally and linguistically diverse exceptional students: Strategies for teaching and assessment.</i> Copyright � 2003 by SAGE Publications. Reprinted by permission of SAGE Publications.<p>Finally, when assessing the language skills of children who are dual or multilanguage learners, it is critical to gather information about the child's language acquisition for each language the child speaks and avoid comparisons with children who are native English speakers (Goodz, 1994). Teachers should determine whether the child who is a dual- or multilanguage learner has an age-appropriate level of vocabulary and syntax in his or her native language in order to evaluate the child's English language acquisition. If there is no communication disorder in the child's native language, then the likelihood is that there is no communication disorder. If possible, another strategy is to compare children who are dual- or multilanguage learners with same-age peers who are also dual- or multilanguage learners. If the child is acquiring English at the same rate as other nonnative English speakers of the same age, then chances are there is no significant communication disorder. In other words, the likelihood of both children exhibiting a communication disorder at the same rate is small. That being said, when making comparisons between children, teachers should consider the length of time each child has been exposed to the new language because children spend a predictable amount of time in each stage of the language acquisition process (Haynes, 2006). </p><p><b>How to Assess</b></p><p>The remainder of the section provides recommendations for <i>how</i> transdisciplinary teams should approach the assessment process for children with diverse abilities (i.e., those who have multiple or severe disabilities, who are from diverse cultural backgrounds, or who are dual- or multilanguage learners). Teachers need to consider the influences and biases inherent to the assessment process, integrate and use interchangeable cuing systems and alternative materials, and allow children to provide alternative responses. </p><p><b><i>Influences and Biases</i></b></p><p>When assessing young children with diverse abilities, teachers should consider influences and biases created by both the assessment setting or situation and those who are conducting the assessment. Using an authentic assessment approach (i.e., familiar adults in familiar settings) is critical to the success of the assessment process. Research has shown that when conducting assessments of young children who have severe or multiple disabilities, who are from diverse cultural backgrounds, or who are dual or multilanguage learners in familiar settings, familiar adults are able to elicit better performance and more elaborate responses (Barkley, 1982; Copenhaver-Johnson &amp; Katz, 2009; Fuchs &amp; Fuchs, 1984). </p><p>When gathering information for a child who is from a diverse cultural background or who is a dual- or multilanguage learner, teachers should match the child with an examiner who is knowledgeable about the child's culture and who speaks the same language (McLean, 2000). Furthermore, the examiner should understand the language acquisition process. It is important the examiner have a firm understanding of the types of grammatical, phonological, and discourse errors that dual- or multilanguage learners typically make as well as the common errors made in interlanguage (Grassi &amp; Barker, 2010). The term<i> interlanguage</i> refers to a made-up linguistic system developed by a child who is learning a second language in which the child uses language transfer, overgeneralization, and simplification to approximate the target language while preserving features of the native language. When conducting the assessment, if it is not possible to find someone who is knowledgeable about the child's culture, who speaks the same language, or who understands the language acquisition process, the team should at the very least, arrange for a one-on-one situation with an interactive adult, caregiver, or teacher. High-context situations, such as a one-on-one interaction, can enhance receptive language abilities as well as increase the likelihood of expressive speech (Copenhaver-Johnson &amp; Katz, 2009). </p><p><b><i>Interchangeable Cuing Systems</i></b></p><p>Teachers should also try to incorporate interchangeable cuing systems when assessing children with diverse abilities. Assessments should be administered in the mode of communication most commonly used by the child (Espinosa, 2005). Often, the mode of communication used by children with diverse abilities is nonverbal. Teachers should incorporate the use of picture communication systems, augmentative communication devices, object and tactile cues, and gestures or sign language when appropriate. Nevertheless, teachers should beware of translating standardized verbal tests into any alternative mode of communication. For example, sign language is not a precise equivalent of spoken language, so translation can invalidate the standardization of test procedures (Schum, 2004). </p><p>For children who are dual- or multilanguage learners, assessments should be administered in the child's native language. Keep in mind, again, that translation is not always an exact science. Sometimes words or phrases can sound inappropriate and even offensive to another culture (Fabri &amp; Freidel, 2008). If an English language assessment is translated into another language, the assessment should be carefully reviewed for linguistic and cultural appropriateness by someone who understands the language and culture and who is well versed in the complex issues of both assessment and translation (National Association for the Education of Young Children, 2009). When translation is not available, nonverbal cuing systems paired with multiple visual or gestural cues can support the assessment of young children who are dual- or multilanguage learners. </p><p>In addition to using interchangeable cuing systems, the manner in which cues are represented should be adjusted to match the needs of the child. For example, children with receptive language deficits will benefit when test questions, instructions, and commands are short, concrete, and repeated (Zentall, 1988). For children with hearing impairments, teachers should ensure the administration of any auditory information is within the child's acuity level. Pairing appropriate cues with reinforcement can help improve motivation and, therefore, test performance for children with behavioral disabilities (Singh, Barto, &amp; Chentanez, 2005). When using reinforcers, teachers should consider the interests and preferences of the child. For example, for children with autism, repetitive stimulation (e.g., strobe light, vibration, rocking) can be more motivating than typical primary reinforcers (e.g., food; Freeman, Frankel, &amp; Ritvo, 1976; Margolies, 1977). </p><p><b><i>Alternative, Flexible Materials</i></b></p><p>When assessing young children with diverse abilities, teachers also need to utilize alternative and flexible materials. Choosing materials that are a match for the child's capabilities and that allow for flexibility in the assessment process will give children with diverse abilities multiple ways of accessing the test content. For example, when children have visual impairments, teachers should choose materials that provide tactile information or large, contrasting visual displays. For children with behavior disorders, instruments with more manipulative items and shorter duration of tasks are an appropriate choice (Shaw, 2008). </p><p>Specifically for young children who have diverse cultural backgrounds or who are dual- or multilanguage learners, teachers should use materials that align with the child's cultural or linguistic background. The National Association for the Education of Young Children (2005) recommends a systematic, observational assessment process incorporating culturally and linguistically appropriate tools as the primary source of guidance. In other words, when using multiple assessments, teachers should rely more heavily on those which are 1) observation based and 2) culturally and linguistically appropriate for the child (Espinosa, in press). If the transdisciplinary team has enlisted the support of a "cultural guide" who knows and understands the child's language and culture, that person can help determine the appropriateness of assessment tools by examining them for cultural bias. </p><p><b><i>Alternative Responses</i></b></p><p>When allowing for alternative responses, teachers should consider the strengths of the child and attempt to align the response options with the child's unique set of skills (Neisworth &amp; Bagnato, 2004). For example, instruments that emphasize nonverbal procedures, such as pointing to pictures or signaling choice with an eye gaze are appropriate for children with communication disorders or who are nonverbal. For children with motor impairments, teachers should acknowledge and verify movement responses that are approximations of standard responses and appear to demonstrate intent (Robinson &amp; Fieber, 1988).

They fell in love, married, and settled into domestic bliss. Then Eiolf&#x2019;s unexpected death at fifty-four left Woon struggling to imagine a life without the man who had been her partner and anchor for thirty-two years. Adrift in grief, she signed up for a beginner&#x2019;s course on mushrooming&#x2014;a course the two of them had planned to take together&#x2014;and found, to her surprise, that the pursuit of mushrooms rekindled her zest for life.<br><br> <i>The Way Through the Woods</i> tells the story of parallel journeys: an inner one, through the landscape of mourning, and an outer one, into the fascinating realm of mushrooms&#x2014;resilient, adaptable, and essential to nature&#x2019;s cycle of death and rebirth. From idyllic Norwegian forests and urban flower beds to the sandy beaches of Corsica and New York&#x2019;s Central Park, Woon uncovers an abundance of surprises often hidden in plain sight: salmon-pink Bloody Milk Caps, which ooze red liquid when cut; delectable morels, prized for their earthy yet delicate flavor; and bioluminescent mushrooms that light up the forest at night.<br><br> Along the way, she discovers the warm fellowship of other mushroom obsessives, and finds that giving her full attention to the natural world transforms her, opening a way for her to survive Eiolf&#x2019;s death, to see herself anew, and to reengage with life.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>The Way Through the Woods</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In her search for new meaning in life after the death of her husband, Long Litt Woon undertook the study of mushrooms. What she found in the woods, and expresses with such tender joy in this heartfelt memoir, was nothing less than salvation.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Eugenia Bone, author of<i> Mycophilia </i>and<i> Microbia</i></b></p><p><b>Long Litt Woon</b>&nbsp;is a Malaysian-born Norwegian social anthropologist and certified mushroom expert. She lives in Oslo, Norway. Her surname is Long in accordance to Chinese naming tradition. She is known as Woon to friends.Chapter 1<br><br>One Mushroom, One Delight. <br><br>Two Mushrooms, Double Delight<br><br>This is the story of a journey that started on the day my life was turned upside down: the day when Eiolf went to work and didn&#x2019;t come home. He never came home again. Life as I had known it was gone in that instant. The world would never be the same again.<br><br>I was devastated. The pain of my loss was all that was left of him. It tore me apart, but I had no wish to dull the agony with painkillers. It was confirmation that he had lived, that he had been my husband. I did not want that to be gone as well.<br><br>I was in free fall. I, who had always been in command and in control, I, who liked to have a firm grip on things. My lodestar was gone. I found myself in unknown territory, a reluctant wanderer in a strange land. Visibility was poor and I had neither map nor compass. Which way was up, which way was down? From which corner should I start walking? Where should I set my foot?<br><br>There was nothing but blackness.<br><br>To my surprise, I chanced upon the answers to these questions where I least expected them.<br><br>The weather was damp, there was a light drizzle in the air, and the dead leaves that had fallen from the tall, venerable trees in Oslo&#x2019;s Botanical Garden were starting to molder. There was no doubt that the warm days were over and a colder season was starting to encroach on our lives. Someone had told me about this course and I had signed up for it without giving it much thought. It was something Eiolf and I had talked about doing but never got around to. So, one autumn-dark evening I presented myself, not expecting too much, in the basement of the Natural History Museum at the University of Oslo.<br><br>I needed to watch my step: I had already broken an ankle just after Eiolf&#x2019;s funeral, and the fear of falling remained with me long after the accident. I had been told that it takes a while for a broken ankle to heal, but whether a broken heart could ever be whole again and, if so, how long that might take, no one could tell me.<br><br>Grief grinds slowly: it devours all the time it needs.<br><br>The course of bereavement does not run smooth; it progresses in fits and starts, takes unforeseeable turns.<br><br>If anyone had told me that mushrooms would be my lifeline, the thing that would help me back onto my feet and quite literally back on life&#x2019;s track, I would have rolled my eyes. What had mushrooms to do with mourning?<br><br>Only later did it dawn on me that mushrooms had been my rescue in my hour of need and that seemingly unrelated subjects such as mushrooms and mourning can, in fact, be connected. It was out in the open woodland, on moss-covered ground, that I stumbled on what I was searching for. My exploration of the mushrooms&#x2019; terrain also became a ramble through an inner landscape, a via interna. The outer journey has been time-consuming. So, too, has the inner journey. It has been turbulent and challenging. For me there is no doubt that my discovery of the realm of fungi steadily nudged me out of the tunnel of grief. It eased the pain and became my path out of the darkness. It offered me fresh perspectives and led me, little by little, to a new standpoint. That is what this book is about.<br><br>I had better start, therefore, with the beginners&#x2019; guide to mushrooms.<br><br>Mushrooms for Beginners<br><br>A lot of people had signed up for the course. Some were in the flower of youth, others enjoying a second blooming. They came from all over the city. This was, it seemed, an interest shared by denizens of both the west and east sides of Oslo. As a social scientist I find this interesting. We are inclined to associate certain sections of society with particular sports or hobbies. Some leisure pursuits have distinctly middle-class overtones, while others are seen as the province of different socioeconomic groups. You don&#x2019;t have to be an anthropologist to discern this pattern in Oslo, although Norwegians love their image as an egalitarian nation. Given the choice, Norwegians would pick the photograph of King Olav V buying a ticket on the train to the Holmenkollen ski slopes as their country&#x2019;s profile picture. And even though it is true that few other monarchs have ever traveled by public transportation, it is also the case that the Norwegian royal family is not generally given to taking the bus or the train. That particular photo was taken in 1973.<br><br>There was something classless about the mushroom community that immediately appealed to me. I&#x2019;ve been one of their number for some time now, yet I still don&#x2019;t know what the mushroomers I meet do in their day-to-day lives. Talk of fungi crowds out everything else. Trivial matters such as religion and politics take a back seat. Not that there isn&#x2019;t a hierarchy among mushroom enthusiasts: this field, too, has its heroes and villains, its unwritten rules and its conflicts, with plenty of scope for feelings to run high. Like all other communities, mushroom pickers represent a microcosm of society as a whole, although I didn&#x2019;t see this to begin with.<br><br>Mushrooms induce a blend of fascination and fear: they lure us with the promise of sensual delights, but with the threat of deadly poison lurking in the background. Not only that, but certain species grow in fairy rings and others have hallucinogenic properties. Delve into historical sources and you will find that down through the ages people have always been fascinated by fungi: they have no roots, no visible seeds, and yet they will suddenly spring up, often after heavy rain and thunderstorms, almost like the incarnation of the untamed forces of nature. The folk names for some fungi&#x2014;Witch&#x2019;s Egg, Devil&#x2019;s Urn, or Jack-o&#x2019;-Lantern, for example&#x2014;suggest that mushrooms were once seen as having a whiff of paganism about them, of being uncanny, magical.<br><br>For some, an interest in fungi is sparked by a fascination with their function as the recyclers of the ecosystem. Others are more interested in their medicinal properties. There is a lot of optimism surrounding research into the uses of mushrooms in the treatment of cancer. Norway has made its own contribution to medical science with the cyclosporin fungus, Tolypocladium inflatum, found on the Hardangervidda plateau, an extract of which forms the basis of an indispensable drug used in organ transplants. Some munch the phallic Common Stinkhorn, Phallos impudicus, or the equally priapic Dog Stinkhorn, Mutinus ravenelii, imagining that mushrooms can work wonders as aphrodisiacs. Handcraft enthusiasts have embraced fungi as new and exciting sources of dyes for wool, linen, and silk. For nature photographers, fungi present a riotous cornucopia: mushrooms come not only in brown and white but in every imaginable, and unimaginable, shape and hue. They may be stubby and springy, lovely and graceful, delicate and transparent, or so spectacular and bizarre that they seem like something from another planet. Some are even luminescent and can light up a forest path when darkness falls.<br><br>However, most of the people I know who are interested in learning about picking wild mushrooms do so because they enjoy eating them. &#x201c;Can you eat it?&#x201d; is the question that the majority of those who don&#x2019;t know much about mushrooms ask again and again. Despite determined efforts, commercial growers have not succeeded in growing the most sought-after mushrooms. So fungi could be said to provide the perfect antithesis to the regimented world in which most of us live.<br><br>The antiquated name of the body that was offering the course had piqued my interest: the Greater Oslo Fungi and Useful Plants Society&#x2014;it sounded like a sister organization to the Norwegian Women&#x2019;s Hygiene Association. What sort of people got involved with fungi and useful plants? To be honest, I wasn&#x2019;t sure what constituted a useful plant. And if you pursued that line of thought, what about useless plants? Was there a society for them as well? I didn&#x2019;t dare ask this question in front of everyone else.<br><br>The leader of the course had a knife in a leather sheath at his belt and a small magnifying glass hanging from a cord around his neck: both these items form an essential part of the serious mushroom forager&#x2019;s uniform, although I didn&#x2019;t know that then. Style, I would learn, is not high on a mushroomer&#x2019;s list of priorities. When you go hunting in the forest, your clothing has to be practical and functional. Which is why, at first glance, mushroom gatherers can look almost like aliens, clad top to toe in Gore-Tex and slathered in lotions to ward off mosquitoes, midges, and deer flies.<br><br>Like all good teachers, our instructor started by establishing how much his students knew. &#x201c;So, what are mushrooms?&#x201d; he asked. Many of the class members said nothing and tried to avoid the teacher&#x2019;s eye. As did I. Surely that was obvious, everybody knew what a mushroom was. But the teacher was looking for a more scientific answer, and I had no idea where to start looking for such a thing.</p><h2>One Night for Love: A Novel (Bedwyn Saga)</h2><p>One reckless man . . .

When Lily's father is mortally wounded, Neville promises the dying man that he will protect Lily by marrying her and giving her his name; as an officer's wife--and a viscountess to boot--Lily will be treated with respect in case of capture. But the two share only one glorious night of passion and discovery after their wedding, for the next day Neville watches in horror as Lily, his wife and the woman he loves, is killed in a skirmish with the French. He, too, is severely wounded and barely escapes with his life. Eighteen months later, Neville is again preparing to be married, this time to the eminently suitable young woman his family has always planned for him to wed. However, one of the guests, albeit uninvited, has grounds to object to the union; the groom is already married--to her! Neville and Lily struggle to wed their worlds together while overcoming the horror of Lily's capture and imprisonment, while a secret lurks nearby that threatens to destroy their growing love. Balogh's latest effort is an extraordinary tale of love found, lost, and found again. <i>--Alison Trinkle</i>"Mary Balogh is the writer I read for pleasure."<br>--Susan Elizabeth Phillips, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author<p>"Ms. Balogh is a veritable treasure, a matchless storyteller who makes our hearts melt with delight."<br>--<i>Romantic Times</i></p><p>"Balogh is truly a find." <br>--<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p></p><h2>The Mysteries Of Pittsburgh</h2><p><p><strong>The enthralling debut from bestselling novelist Michael Chabon is a penetrating narrative of complex friendships, father-son conflicts, and the awakening of a young man&#x2019;s sexual identity. </strong></p><p>Chabon masterfully renders the funny, tender, and captivating first-person narrative of Art Bechstein,whose confusion and heartache echo the tones of literary forebears like <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em>&#x2019;s Holden Caulfield and <em>The Great Gatsby</em>&#x2019;s Nick Carraway<em>. </em></p><p><em>The Mysteries of Pittsburgh </em>incontrovertibly established Chabon as a powerful force in contemporary fiction, even before his Pulitzer Prize-winning novel <em>The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay </em>set the literary world spinning.

Mad indeed would I be to expect it, in a case where my very senses reject their own evidence. Yet, mad am I not&#x2014;and very surely do I not dream. But tomorrow I die, and today I would unburden my soul. My immediate purpose is to place before the world, plainly, succinctly, and without comment, a series of mere household events. In their consequences, these events have terrified&#x2014;have tortured&#x2014;have destroyed me. Yet I will not attempt to expound them. To me, they have presented little but horror&#x2014;to many they will seem less terrible than baroques. Hereafter, perhaps, some intellect may be found which will reduce my phantasm to the commonplace&#x2014;some intellect more calm, more logical, and far less excitable than my own, which will perceive, in the circumstances I detail with awe, nothing more than an ordinary succession of very natural causes and effects.<br> &nbsp;<br> From my infancy I was noted for the docility and humanity of my disposition. My tenderness of heart was even so conspicuous as to make me the jest of my companions. I was especially fond of animals, and was indulged by my parents with a great variety of pets. With these I spent most of my time, and never was so happy as when feeding and caressing them. This peculiarity of character grew with my growth, and, in my manhood, I derived from it one of my principal sources of pleasure. To those who have cherished an affection for a faithful and sagacious dog, I need hardly be at the trouble of explaining the nature or the intensity of the gratification thus derivable. There is something in the unselfish and self-sacrificing love of a brute, which goes directly to the heart of him who has had frequent occasion to test the paltry friendship and gossamer fidelity of mere Man.<br> &nbsp;<br> I married early, and was happy to find in my wife a disposition not uncongenial with my own. Observing my partiality for domestic pets, she lost no opportunity of procuring those of the most agreeable kind. We had birds, gold-fish, a fine dog, rabbits, a small monkey, and a cat.<br> &nbsp;<br> This latter was a remarkably large and beautiful animal, entirely black, and sagacious to an astonishing degree. In speaking of his intelligence, my wife, who at heart was not a little tinctured with superstition, made frequent allusion to the ancient popular notion, which regarded all black cats as witches in disguise. Not that she was ever serious upon this point&#x2014;and I mention the matter at all for no better reason than that it happens, just now, to be remembered.<br> &nbsp;<br> Pluto&#x2014;this was the cat&#x2019;s name&#x2014;was my favorite pet and playmate. I alone fed him, and he attended me wherever I went about the house. It was even with difficulty that I could prevent him from following me through the streets.<br> &nbsp;<br> Our friendship lasted, in this manner, for several years, during which my general temperament and character&#x2014;through the instrumentality of the Fiend Intemperance&#x2014;had (I blush to confess it) experienced a radical alteration for the worse. I grew, day by day, more moody, more irritable, more regardless of the feelings of others. I suffered myself to use intemperate language to my wife. At length, I even offered her personal violence. My pets, of course, were made to feel the change in my disposition. I not only neglected, but ill-used them. For Pluto, however, I still retained sufficient regard to restrain me from maltreating him, as I made no scruple of maltreating the rabbits, the monkey, or even the dog, when, by accident, or through affection, they came in my way. But my disease grew upon me&#x2014;for what disease is like Alcohol!&#x2014;and at length even Pluto, who was now becoming old, and consequently somewhat peevish&#x2014;even Pluto began to experience the effects of my ill temper.<br> &nbsp;<br> One night, returning home, much intoxicated, from one of my haunts about town, I fancied that the cat avoided my presence. I seized him; when, in his fright at my violence, he inflicted a slight wound upon my hand with his teeth. The fury of a demon instantly possessed me. I knew myself no longer. My original soul seemed, at once, to take its flight from my body; and a more than fiendish malevolence, gin-nurtured, thrilled every fibre of my frame. I took from my waistcoat-pocket a penknife, opened it, grasped the poor beast by the throat, and deliberately cut one of its eyes from the socket! I blush, I burn, I shudder, while I pen the damnable atrocity.<br> &nbsp;<br> When reason returned with the morning&#x2014;when I had slept off the fumes of the night&#x2019;s debauch&#x2014;I experienced a sentiment half of horror, half of remorse, for the crime of which I had been guilty; but it was, at best, a feeble and equivocal feeling, and the soul remained untouched. I again plunged into excess, and soon drowned in wine all memory of the deed.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the meantime the cat slowly recovered. The socket of the lost eye presented, it is true, a frightful appearance, but he no longer appeared to suffer any pain. He went about the house as usual, but, as might be expected, fled in extreme terror at my approach. I had so much of my old heart left, as to be at first grieved by this evident dislike on the part of a creature which had once so loved me. But this feeling soon gave place to irritation. And then came, as if to my final and irrevocable overthrow, the spirit of PERVERSENESS. Of this spirit philosophy takes no account. Yet I am not more sure that my soul lives, than I am that perverseness is one of the primitive impulses of the human heart&#x2014;one of the indivisible primary faculties, or sentiments, which give direction to the character of Man. Who has not, a hundred times, found himself committing a vile or a stupid action, for no other reason than because he knows he should not? Have we not a perpetual inclination, in the teeth of our best judgment, to violate that which is Law, merely because we understand it to be such? This spirit of perverseness, I say, came to my final overthrow. It was this unfathomable longing of the soul to vex itself&#x2014;to offer violence to its own nature&#x2014;to do wrong for the wrong&#x2019;s sake only&#x2014;that urged me to continue and finally to consummate the injury I had inflicted upon the unoffending brute. One morning, in cold blood, I slipped a noose about its neck and hung it to the limb of a tree;&#x2014;hung it with the tears streaming from my eyes, and with the bitterest remorse at my heart;&#x2014;hung it because I knew that it had loved me, and because I felt it had given me no reason of offence;&#x2014;hung it because I knew that in so doing I was committing a sin&#x2014;a deadly sin that would so jeopardize my immortal soul as to place it&#x2014;if such a thing were possible&#x2014;even beyond the reach of the infinite mercy of the Most Merciful and Most Terrible God.<br> &nbsp;<br> On the night of the day on which this most cruel deed was done, I was aroused from sleep by the cry of fire. The curtains of my bed were in flames. The whole house was blazing. It was with great difficulty that my wife, a servant, and myself, made our escape from the conflagration. The destruction was complete. My entire worldly wealth was swallowed up, and I resigned myself thenceforward to despair.<br> &nbsp;<br> I am above the weakness of seeking to establish a sequence of cause and effect, between the disaster and the atrocity. But I am detailing a chain of facts&#x2014;and wish not to leave even a possible link imperfect. On the day succeeding the fire, I visited the ruins. The walls, with one exception, had fallen in. This exception was found in a compartment wall, not very thick, which stood about the middle of the house, and against which had rested the head of my bed. The plastering had here, in great measure, resisted the action of the fire&#x2014;a fact which I attributed to its having been recently spread. About this wall a dense crowd were collected, and many persons seemed to be examining a particular portion of it with very minute and eager attention. The words &#x201c;stranger!&#x201d; &#x201c;singular!&#x201d; and other similar expressions, excited my curiosity. I approached and saw, as if graven in bas-relief upon the white surface, the figure of a gigantic cat. The impression was given with an accuracy truly marvelous. There was a rope about the animal&#x2019;s neck.<br> &nbsp;<br> When I first beheld this apparition&#x2014;for I could scarcely regard it as less&#x2014;my wonder and my terror were extreme. But at length reflection came to my aid. The cat, I remembered, had been hung in a garden adjacent to the house. Upon the alarm of fire, this garden had been immediately filled by the crowd&#x2014;by some one of whom the animal must have been cut from the tree and thrown, through an open window, into my chamber. This had probably been done with the view of arousing me from sleep. The falling of other walls had compressed the victim of my cruelty into the substance of the freshly-spread plaster; the lime of which, with the flames, and the ammonia from the carcass, had then accomplished the portraiture as I saw it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Although I thus readily accounted to my reason, if not altogether to my conscience, for the startling fact just detailed, it did not the less fail to make a deep impression upon my fancy. For months I could not rid myself of the phantasm of the cat; and, during this period, there came back into my spirit a half-sentiment that seemed, but was not, remorse. I went so far as to regret the loss of the animal, and to look about me, among the vile haunts which I now habitually frequented, for another pet of the same species, and of somewhat similar appearance, with which to supply its place.</p><h2>Murder Most Frothy (Coffeehouse Mysteries, No. 4)</h2><p><b>Book #4 in <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Cleo Coyle's Coffeehouse Mystery series...</b><br>Clare Cosi's new friend, millionaire David Mintzer, has an offer no New York barista could turn down: an all-expenses-paid summer away from the sticky city.

Provocative and reassuring, nurturing and wise, <em>The Lie That Tells a Truth</em> is essential to writers in general, fiction writers in particular, beginning writers, serious writers, and anyone facing a blank page.</p><p>John Dufresne, teacher and the acclaimed author of <em>Love Warps the Mind a Little</em> and <em>Deep in the Shade of Paradise</em>, demystifies the writing process. Drawing upon the wisdom of literature's great craftsmen, Dufresne's lucid essays and diverse exercises initiate the reader into the tools, processes, and techniques of writing: inventing compelling characters, developing a voice, creating a sense of place, editing your own words. Where do great ideas come from? How do we recognize them? How can language capture them? In his signature comic voice, Dufresne answers these questions and more in chapters such as "Writing Around the Block," "Plottery," and "The Art of Abbreviation." Dufresne demystifies the writing process, showing that while the idea of writing may be overwhelming, the act of writing is simplicity itself.</p></p><p>John Dufresne is the author of elevenprevious books, including three fiction writing guides. A professor in the MFA program at Florida International University, he lives in Dania Beach.A novelist and teacher, Dufresne (Deep in the Shade of Paradise) shares his blunt views on writing in this instruction book, which draws heavily on the tenets of realist fiction and method acting. Divided into two main sections-"The Process" focuses on habits and emotions; "The Product" emphasizes narrative mechanics-Dufresne's manual often adopts the tone of a fiery professor advising a group of wide-eyed young freshmen. "Fiction writing is arrested development," he declares. "Just know that you should quit right now if you can." Readers may sometimes feel lectured by his many stern instructions-"Thou Shalt Not Be Obscure," "Thou Shalt Show and Not Tell," "Thou Shalt Steal"-but the author hits his stride when he covers the mechanics of story. Particularly valuable is his advice on choosing character names, occupations, and points of view. A principle of acting teachers Konstantin Stanislavsky and Michael Chekhov-that exterior movement leads to interior feeling-forms the basis of one of Defresne's two chapters on characterization. Elsewhere, he skillfully analyzes the work of his favorite writers Anton Chekhov, Frank O'Connor and Eudora Welty. (Dufresne also mines his own work for examples of process and technique.) Each chapter closes with a set of writing exercises. Although this volume is unlikely to displace classic fiction guides like E.M. Forster's Aspects of the Novel, many readers may respond to the author's encouraging, exhorting tone. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Orphan&#39;s Tales: In the Night Garden</h2><p><b>A Book of Wonders for Grown-Up Readers</b><br><br> Every once in a great while a book comes along that reminds us of the magic spell that stories can cast over us&#x2013;to dazzle, entertain, and enlighten.

He journeyed through the Forest, stars flooding overhead as though they had burst through some gilded dam, having no particular plan except to get as far from the Palace as possible before the sun rose up and his father's hounds were set on his scent. The trees made a roof of many tiles over his head, a scented mosaic studded with blue clouds. For the first time in his young life, the Prince felt a fierce kind of happiness, rimmed with light.<br><br>As dawn swept up behind him like a clever thief, he rested against the trunk of a great baobab, leaning his head against the knotted wood. He breakfasted on cheese and dried meat he had stolen from the kitchens. The salt of the meat was more delicious than anything he had ever tasted, and he slept for a few hours under the sky which bloomed in the colors of wisteria and lilies.<br><br>Traveling on, it was not long before he came to a little hut in a pleasant meadow with a thatched roof and a well-made wooden door, round with solid brass studs. The chimney smoked cheerily, smelling of sage and cedar. Milling around the house was a flock of gray-feathered geese, circling like cirrus clouds, ethereal and wild. They were very fine animals and beautiful, squawking and ruffling their feathers under the curling eaves of camphor and fresh straw.<br><br>Now the Prince was young and resourceful, but not very wise, and he had taken only a little food from the kitchens and a few apples from the orchards. He had assumed that he could forage easily, for the whole world must be as fertile as his father's lands, and all trees must be as full of jeweled fruit, all animals as docile and savory, all peasants agreeable and generous. It was beginning to be clear that this might not be the case, and his stomach growled noisily. He resolved to replenish his pack before he went further. There were, after all, so many geese, and certainly whatever warm and festive creatures dwelt in that fine hut, they would not even notice if one of the long-necked animals disappeared.<br><br>The Prince had been trained to hunt and sneak from his earliest childhood, and he crept silently on well-muscled thighs from his hiding place. He stole behind a great plow and waited among the high summer grasses, searching for the right moment, controlling his breathing and slowing his hammering heart. The midmorning sun was hot on his neck. His hair crawled with sweat, trickling down into his collar, but he did not move at all until, finally, one of the lovely geese wandered away from the pack, peering around the blade of the plow and fixing him with wide black eyes. Her gaze was very strange, endless and deep as the autumn moon, pupilless and knowing.<br><br>But swift as a sleek wolf, the Prince escaped her gaze. He caught her slender neck in his hand and snapped it, the sound no louder than a twig caught underfoot. He rose from the dry grass and moved back towards the tree line, but the geese had noticed that one of their number was missing, and sent up a great alarm, terrible and piercing.<br><br>The door of the hut flew open and out stomped a fearful woman, a flurry of streaming gray hair and glinting axe blade. Her face was wide and flat, covered with horrible and arcane markings, great black tattoos and scars cutting across her features so that it was impossible to tell if she had once been beautiful. She wore a wide leather belt studded with silver, two long knives glittering at her hips. She screamed horribly and the sound of it shook the cypresses and the oaks, vibrating in the air like a shattered flute.<br><br>"What have you done? What have you done? Awful, awful boy!&#x2014;Villain, demon!" She screeched again, higher and shriller than any owl, and the geese joined her, keening and wailing. Their howls gouged at the air, at the rich red earth, a sound both monstrous and alien, full of inhuman, bottomless grief. It dug at his ears like claws.<br><br>Finally, the woman quieted and simply shook her great head, weeping. The Prince stood, stunned, more chagrined over his lack of stealth than her rage. She was, after all, only a woman, and it was only a bird. She was dwarfish and no longer young, and he knew he had nothing to fear from her. He clutched the bird's corpse behind his back, hoping his broad chest and arms would hide it.<br><br>"I have only just stumbled upon your house, Lady. I meant no offense." The wretched woman loosed her awful scream again, and her eyes grew hideously large. He had not noticed their yellowish cast before, but it was certainly there now, feral and sickly.<br><br>"You lie, you lie! You have killed my goose, my beautiful bird, my child! She was mine and you broke her neck! My darling, my child!" She broke into bitter weeping. The Prince could not understand. He drew the goose's body from behind his back to hold it out to the crone.<br><br>But in his fist he held not a bird, but a radiant young woman, small and delicate as a crane poised in the water, long black hair like a coiled serpent winding around his hand, for he clutched her at the root of the braided mane. She was clothed in diaphanous rags which barely covered her shimmering limbs. And her long, smooth neck was neatly broken.<br><br>The tattooed woman ran at him, swinging her axe like a scythe through wheat, and he dropped the girl's body with a horrible thump onto the grass. When she reached him, she stopped short and breathed hard into his face, stinking of rotted plums and dark, secret mosses. She lifted her axe and cut off two fingers on the Prince's left hand, licking the spray of blood from her cracked lips. He could not run, the blow was so sudden and complete, but only cry out and clutch his maimed hand. He knew if he bolted from her he would lose much more than a finger. He promised the crone a thousand thousand kingdoms, the treasures of a hundred dragons, babbling oaths like a child. But she would have none of it, and slowly moved her free hand to one of the long knives.<br><br>"You have killed my child, my only daughter."<br><br>She laid her ponderous axe on the damp earth and drew, with one long, sinuous sigh, the bright-bladed knife from its sheath&#x2014;<br>The girl paused, and looked into her companion's eyes, which were like deep marshes at sunset.<br><br>"Don't stop!" he choked. "Tell me! Did she kill him then and there?"<br><br>"It is night, boy. You must go in to dinner and I must make my bed among the cedar boughs. Each to our own."<br><br>The boy gaped, grasping frantically for a reason to stay and hear the fate of the wounded Prince. Hurriedly, he murmured, "Wait, wait. I will go to dinner, and steal food for us like the brave Prince Leander, and creep out under cover of night like a hawk on the hunt, and stay the night with you, here under the stars, which are bright as crane feathers in the sun. Then you can finish the story." He looked at her with a hope whose fierceness was brighter than any torch now lit at court.<br><br>She was quiet for a moment, head bowed like a temple postulant.<br><br>Finally, she nodded, without looking up.<br><br>"Very well."<br><i>In the Garden<br></i><br>As the last harp strings of crimson sighed into the silent westward darkness, the boy returned, clutching a handkerchief filled to bursting. He clambered into the little thicket and proudly laid out their feast. The girl sat as she had when he left her, still as one of the calm profiles of the garden statues. Her strange quiet unnerved him, frightened him. He could not hold her dark gaze, her wide, almond-shaped eyes ringed about with their strange markings.<br><br>Instead, he glanced awkwardly at the steaming food. On the little square of silk lay a glistening roasted dove, fat peaches and cold pears, a half loaf of buttery bread covered in jam, broiled turnips and potatoes, a lump of hard cheese, and several sugared violets whisked away from the table garnish. He drew from his pocket a flask of pale watered wine, the great prize of his kitchen adventures.<br><br>The girl made no move, did not reach for the dove or the pears. Her crow-feather hair wafted into her face, borne by the warm breeze, and all at once she began to shudder and weep. The boy did not know where to look, did not wish to shame her by witnessing her tears. He fixed his eyes on the shivering boughs of a distant cypress tree, and waited. By and by, the sniffling ceased, and he turned back to her.<br><br>Of course, he understood that she had never eaten so well in her life, as she had never been welcome at the palace dinners&#x2014;he imagined that she had lived on the fruits and nuts of the garden, foraging like a beggar. But he could not understand why plenty would make someone weep. His hands were soft and scented with rose oil, and his hair gleamed. He had known nothing but the court and the peculiar adoration it bestowed on beautiful youths. But he was a child of nobility, and would not embarrass her with displays of compassion.<br><br>Wordlessly, she tore a wing off the coppery dove and delicately mouthed the meat. With a small, ornate silver knife hidden in the folds of her plain shift she sliced a pear in two. As she extended one pale green half to the boy, he wondered vaguely how she had come upon such a handsome knife. Certainly he had nothing so fine, and yet her dress, such as it was, was threadbare and her fingernails dirty. A thread of fragrant juice ran down her chin, and for the first time, the girl smiled, and it was like the moonrise over a mountain stream, the light caught in a stag's pale antlers, clear water running under the night sky. When she spoke again, the boy leaned forward eagerly, shoved his thick, dark hair back from his face, bit into a ripe peach and stuffed a bit of cheese into his mouth, mechanically, without noticing the taste. Her large eyes slid shut as she spoke, so that her eyelids and their mosaic covering seemed to float like black lilies in the paleness of her face.<br><br>"The wild woman drew her long knife from her belt and held it for a moment, almost playfully, at the Prince's smooth neck, a sliver of breath before the fatal cut . . ."<br><i>The Tale of the Prince and the Goose, Continued<br></i><br>"Let me live, lady," he whispered, "I beg you. I shall stay here and be your servant; I will take the place of the bird-maiden and remain loyal to you for all of my days. I will be yours. I am young and strong. Please."<br><br>He did not know what moved him to make such an offer, or if he meant to keep his promise, true as law. But the words ripped from him as though the woman had put her fist into his throat and seized them for her own.<br><br>Her eyes blazed like clouds filled with a thousand tiny seeds of lightning. But they held now a calculating gleam, and indeed, in another instant the knife had vanished from the Prince's throat.<br><br>"Even if I agree it will not save you," she hissed, her voice like a great toad singing at dawn. "But I will tell you the tale of my daughter and how she became winged. Then, perhaps, you will see what it is you offer, and we shall discover whether or not you prefer death."<br><br>But she did not speak. Instead, she tore a long strip of mottled fur from the collar of her tunic and bandaged his hand. Her touch was practiced and much softer than he expected, almost, though not quite, tender. From a pouch at her waist she drew some withered leaves, among which he thought he could recognize bay and juniper. She pressed them into his ruined stumps. Tightening the poultice, she examined her work and judged it fair.<br><br>"First, I am not blind. I can see that you are young and strong, and there is no doubt I can use up your youth and vigor like well water. This is not the question. Can you listen? Can you learn? Can you keep silent? I wonder. I believe you are a spoiled brat with no ears at all."<br><br>The Prince bent his head, penitent. Already his hand had stopped its thick throbbing, and he said nothing, judging that nothing was the best shield he could fashion against her. The crone sat against a large stone and rolled a few musky leaves between her gnarled fingers . . .<br><i>The Witch's Tale<br></i><br>I came from the northern tribes, the steppe-women with their shaggy horses and snow-clotted braids. I'm sure you've heard stories&#x2013;we were monsters, we were unnatural, we deserved what we got.<br><br>Among the unnatural monsters, I was more monstrous and more unnatural than the rest. They called me Knife. When I was young and my strength was taut as a bowstring, I was the best rider of all the young girls. I had many necklaces of jasper and wolf-tooth, three fine hunting knives, a strong bow that I could draw into the shape of the full moon, a quiver full of arrows fletched in hawk feathers, and a wildcat hide from my first kill. All around me were the wild, honey-colored steppes, the fat deer we hunted, and the sleek, brown, fragrant horses I loved. They ran like ripples in a mountain lake. I ran alongside them, and rode astride them, and I slept against their flanks.<br><br>I was happy, the sun was high. I had enough.<br><br>My sisters were all older than I, my brothers away fighting on the borders of our country, and so I was free, and feral, and my smile was often too like a snarl. One day Grandmother Bent-Bow, whom everyone called Grandmother but who was truly mine, and had the ugliest face I knew, like beaten bark, called me to her under the new moon. She told me that she had found a man for me to marry. I loved my grandmother very much, but I did not care to be married. I was a muscle-knotted mare; I needed no mount to slow me down. But Grandmother's word was the closest thing to law we had. Monsters, you know, cannot appreciate the niceties of commandments carved in stone.</p><h2>Introducing the Old Testament</h2><p><p><i>The newest and best Old Testament intro for university and seminary students</i></p><p>In this up-to-date, student-friendly text, Robert Hubbard and J.

This first volume, covering the first two and a quarter years of the strip, features hundreds of strips rarely reprinted before this series. Three major cast members �&#x20ac;&#x201d; Schroeder, Lucy, and Linus �&#x20ac;&#x201d; initially show up as infants and only �&#x20ac;&#x153;grow�&#x20ac; into their final �&#x20ac;&#x153;mature�&#x20ac; selves as the months go by. Even Snoopy debuts as a puppy! The Complete Peanuts offers a unique chance to see a master of the art form refine his skills and solidify his universe, day by day. This volume is rounded out with Garrison Keillor�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s introduction, a biographical essay by David Michaelis (Schulz and Peanuts) and an in-depth interview with Schulz conducted in 1987 by Gary Groth and Rick Marschall.</p><p>Good grief! <i>The Complete Peanuts 1950-1952</i> launches the most ambitious and most important project in the comics and cartooning genre: over a period of 12 years, Fantagraphics Books will release every daily and Sunday strip of Charles M. Schulz's "Peanuts," the best-known and best-loved series in the world. Most everyone with an interest in its history has seen the very first strip ("Good ol' Charlie Brown... How I hate him!"), but this first volume follows it up with 287 pages (three daily strips or one Sunday per page) of vintage material in chronological order. "Peanuts" was unique at the time for portraying kids who seemed like real kids, but they also had a wisdom beyond their years, embodied especially by the lovable loser, Charlie Brown, who even in these early years has lost 4000 checker games in a row. We see him don his familiar jagged-stripe shirt for the first time (December 1950) and, at the age of 4, at his peak as a babe magnet. Shermy is the other significant boy, and the girls in their lives are Patty (not to be confused with Peppermint Patty) and Violet. Schroeder is an infant who has learned to sit up in order to play Beethoven on his toy piano. Snoopy is an anthropomorphic dog who plays baseball (April 1952) and has his own thoughts (October 1952). In March 1952 we meet a bug-eyed Lucy, who by November has been designated "Miss Fuss-Budget of 1952" and is pulling the football away from Charlie Brown (Violet had done it a year earlier). Her baby brother Linus arrives in July 1952. The book itself is beautifully packaged, the strips printed large and clear on high-quality paper and accompanied by an in-depth essay by David Michaelis, a 1987 interview with Schulz, an introduction by Garrison Keillor, and even an index of characters and subjects. It's so well-done that any reader will be impatient for the rest of the series, but in the meantime this is a book to savor. <i>--David Horiuchi</i>Charles M. Schulz was born November 25, 1922, in Minneapolis. His destiny was foreshadowed when an uncle gave him, at the age of two days, the nickname Sparky (after the racehorse Spark Plug in the newspaper strip Barney Google).In his senior year in high school, his mother noticed an ad in a local newspaper for a correspondence school, Federal Schools (later called Art Instruction Schools). Schulz passed the talent test, completed the course, and began trying, unsuccessfully, to sell gag cartoons to magazines. (His first published drawing was of his dog, Spike, and appeared in a 1937 Ripley's Believe It or Not! installment.) Between 1948 and 1950, he succeeded in selling 17 cartoons to the Saturday Evening Post&#x2015;as well as, to the local St. Paul Pioneer Press, a weekly comic feature called Li'l Folks. It was run in the women's section and paid $10 a week. After writing and drawing the feature for two years, Schulz asked for a better location in the paper or for daily exposure, as well as a raise. When he was turned down on all three counts, he quit.He started submitting strips to the newspaper syndicates. In the spring of 1950, he received a letter from the United Feature Syndicate, announcing their interest in his submission, Li'l Folks. Schulz boarded a train in June for New York City; more interested in doing a strip than a panel, he also brought along the first installments of what would become Peanuts&#x2015;and that was what sold. (The title, which Schulz loathed to his dying day, was imposed by the syndicate.) The first Peanuts daily appeared October 2, 1950; the first Sunday, January 6, 1952.Diagnosed with cancer, Schulz retired from Peanuts at the end of 1999. He died on February 13, 2000, the day before Valentine's Day&#x2015;and the day before his last strip was published&#x2015;having completed 17,897 daily and Sunday strips, each and every one fully written, drawn, and lettered entirely by his own hand&#x2015;an unmatched achievement in comics.</p><h2>Rooted and Rising: Voices of Courage in a Time of Climate Crisis</h2><p>Rooted and Rising is for everyone who worries about the climate crisis and seeks spiritual practices and perspectives to renew their capacity for compassionate, purposeful, and joyful action.<br><br>Leah Schade and Margaret Bullitt-Jonas gather twenty-one faith leaders, scientists, community organizers, theologians, and grassroots climate activists to offer wisdom for fellow pilgrims grappling with the weight of climate change.

Together, the essays, introductory sections, and discussion questions reveal that our present crisis can elicit a depth of wisdom, insight, and motivation with power to guide us toward a more peaceful, just, and Earth-honoring future. <br><br>With a foreword by Mary Evelyn Tucker and a special introduction by Bill McKibben, the book presents an interfaith perspective that welcomes and challenges readers of all backgrounds.</p><p>Leah Schade, PhD, is a Lutheran pastor, eco-theologian, author of Creation-Crisis Preaching: Ecology, Theology and the Pulpit, and assistant professor of preaching and worship at Lexington Theological Seminary in Kentucky.<br><br>Margaret Bullitt-Jonas, PhD, is an Episcopal priest, author, and climate activist serving as missioner for Creation Care in the Episcopal Diocese of Western Massachusetts and Massachusetts Conference, United Church of Christ.If you're part of the &#x2018;choir&#x2019; regarding climate change, if you get it, if you're on board, this is the book you need right now.

Just in time for the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, Rooted and Rising provides a powerful spiritual and moral case for people of faith becoming involved in climate activism. (Denis Hayes, founder of The Earth Day Network)<br><br>It is now clear: prophetic, spiritual resilience in the face of the Earth emergency is indispensable to our health and a catalyst for any eco-social transformation we might muster. In Rooted &amp; Rising, climate activists beneath the Abrahamic canopy&#x2014;Jews, Muslims, Christians&#x2014;voice exactly what we need and show the way. Kudos to Margaret Bullitt-Jonas and Leah Schade for convening this remarkable gathering and offering spiritual practices to accompany the inspiring witness.

This book is for everyone who has been frustrated by the lack of progress in addressing climate change. These pages will educate and inspire you and renew your strength. (Sally Bingham, founder and president emeritus, Interfaith Power and Light)<br><br>Rooted and Rising is a deeply personal series of essays by those who see climate activism as a calling. At a time when the challenge may seem insurmountable, this book is a celebration of community. These essays show us that doing the work becomes its own end, and that the fulfillment we find in each other and in nature nourishes and sustains us in the struggle. <br><br> (Nicole Ghio, Fossil Fuels Program Manager, Friends of the Earth)<br><br>Rooted &amp; Rising: Voices of Courage in a Time of Climate Crisis is a true gem. Filled with inspiring personal stories, contemplations on how to live with honesty and compassion in the midst of climate disruption, thoughtful questions for the reader to consider, and creative rituals to access our deepest emotional responses to the climate crisis, this book is a must-read for anyone and everyone who cares about planet Earth and all of its inhabitants. (Katy Z. Allen, eco-chaplain and founder of Ma'yan Tikvah: A Wellspring of Hope and co-founder of Jewish Climate Action Network)<br><br>Hope flows, aided by spirit; fear and grief must be named and honored; resilience and justice are within us; holy paradoxes abound, as people of faith confront our climate-imperiled era. These are just a few of the vital messages delivered in this poignant, timely, diverse collection. I&#x2019;ll be returning to Rooted and Rising often, and anticipate that many others will, too. (Fred Scherlinder Dobb, Adat Shalom in Bethesda MD; Chair, Coalition on the Environment and Jewish Life)<br><br>This timely book is not about overcoming climate change - it&#x2019;s about climate activism as a devotional practice. It&#x2019;s about honoring God, the Oneness that flows through everything. It&#x2019;s about building community and loving our neighbors (including the whole natural world) and feeding the hungry and protecting the poor. It&#x2019;s about the meaning of faith and about responding with all of our hearts and souls and might to meet the needs of this Climate era. It will motivate you and your communities to live as citizens of one earth. (Ellen Bernstein, author of The Promise of the Land: A Passover Haggadah; Founder, Shomrei Adamah, Keepers of the Earth, first national Jewish environmental organization)<br><br>Margaret Bullitt-Jonas and Leah Schade have gathered the spiritual and practical wisdom we need for such a time as this. As ministers, activists and scholars, they know we must take bold action that heals the land, the waters, the skies and the whole family of God. They also know our faith traditions provide us with the fuel we need. I hope people of faith everywhere will open this book, explore the diverse and rich collection of voices, and be encouraged, challenged, informed, strengthened, rooted and driven to prayer and action. (The Most Rev. Michael B. Curry, presiding bishop of The Episcopal Church)<br><br>This stunning collection of essays is like nothing we have seen before. With its honest acknowledgement of the raw fear, anger, and despair evoked by the climate crisis, Rooted and Rising will take readers to places they have never been &#x2013; but which they need to face. At the same time, the book lifts up something equally real: the extraordinary power of human beings to take collective action, if they so choose. Rooted and Rising shows how claiming our relationship with all of life is the foundation of spirituality (with or without religious faith); how the energy of our feelings can be turned into positive action; and how our lives can find purpose and meaning in this perilous time. <br><br> (Lise Van Susteren, co-author of The Psychological Effects of Global Warming on the United States: And Why the U.S. Mental Health Care System is Not Adequately Prepared and Emotional Inflammation)</p><h2>Wielding a Red Sword (Book Four of Incarnations of Immortality)</h2><p><b>Here in a fourth complete-in-itself novel of the Incarnations of Immortality, Piers Anthony again combines fascinating magic with a gripping, complex struggle between good and evil.</b><br><br>Mym was a dutiful son, but his father the Rajah interfered in his love life once too often.

In this revolutionary book, Gehl presents his latest work creating (or recreating) cityscapes on a human scale. He clearly explains the methods and tools he uses to reconfigure unworkable cityscapes into the landscapes he believes they should be: cities for people.<br><br> Taking into account changing demographics and changing lifestyles, Gehl emphasizes four human issues that he sees as essential to successful city planning. He explains how to develop cities that are Lively, Safe, Sustainable, and Healthy. Focusing on these issues leads Gehl to think of even the largest city on a very small scale. For Gehl, the urban landscape must be considered through the five human senses and experienced at the speed of walking rather than at the speed of riding in a car or bus or train. This small-scale view, he argues, is too frequently neglected in contemporary projects.<br><br> In a final chapter, Gehl makes a plea for city planning on a human scale in the fast- growing cities of developing countries. A &#x201c;Toolbox,&#x201d; presenting key principles, overviews of methods, and keyword lists, concludes the book.<br> The book is extensively illustrated with over 700 photos and drawings of examples from Gehl&#x2019;s work around the globe.</p><p><p>Renowned architect and urban planner Jan Gehl&nbsp;explains the methods and tools he has used to reconfigure unworkable cityscapes into safe and sustainable cities for people &#x2013; something he has helped do in Copenhagen, Melbourne, and New York City.</p>Jan Gehl is a founding partner of Gehl Architects&#x2014;Urban Quality Consultants.

The author presents the history of Greek philosophy as an unfolding conversation, with the key thinkers engaged with and responding to their predecessors. Elegantly and compellingly written, Roochnik demonstrates the abiding relevance of this conversation to the modern reader. In retrieving the ancients, he argues, we help to illuminate ourselves.<b>David Roochnik</b> is Associate Professor of Philosophy at Boston University.

The work includes an excellent general Introduction that, in a lucid and systematic manner, presents the reader with those key aspects of the period's Christian thought and practice against which Luther would react in&nbsp;<i>On the Freedom of a Christian</i>.

The edition's greatest asset, though, is the range of texts that it includes. By including works by Luther's Catholic opponents and his erstwhile allies, this edition demonstrates that&nbsp;<i>On the Freedom of a Christian</i>&nbsp;represented not only a high point in Luther's thought, but also a starting point in a debate that spanned Christendom and had massive social and political implications." &#x2014;Philip Haberkern,&nbsp;Boston University<br><br>"An excellent introduction to both Luther's thought and the theological controversies that tore apart sixteenth century Europe.

The Batcave is, he reports, surprisingly cozy.<br>Starred Review. Batman is pushed past the edge of sanity in this spectacular story that mixes icy mind games and passionate outbursts. A club of criminal masterminds, the Black Glove, has an elaborate plot to make Bruce Wayne/Batman self-destruct by convincing him that all his friends and lovers have betrayed him and that his most trusted memories are false. As clever in their scheming as the villains are, however, they have no idea how thorough Batman has been in planning ways to protect his obsessions; consequently, the action is fractured between scenes of what is really happening, what might be happening, what probably isn't happening, etc. This premise gives scriptwriter Morrison and principal artist Daniel a chance to review key episodes and images from the Caped Crime Fighter's long career&#x2014;including, of course, numerous encounters with the Joker, who's too chaotic to be happy in any organization like the Black Glove, but who struts through the action wielding sardonic humor and two straight razors. Whether Batman winds up (or ever was) totally sane is unresolved, but he's a fascinating protagonist in this sweeping, emotionally draining saga. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Millions of years ago, the star, its fuel dwindling, had gone nova, hurling its outer layers into space and ravaging the worlds that had once orbited it. No longer a nuclear furnace, the star still glowed with bright white light created by the heat of its collapse into a sphere the size of a world like Earth. Over the course of another billion years, the star would expend that heat and gradually cool.<br><br> Humanity arrived, in ships that needed the mass of stars to create jump points allowing those ships to cross light years of distance in a few weeks. The star was given a name, Jatayu, but with only a few battered rocks still circling it, humans went onward to other stars that still warmed worlds where men and women could find new homes. Jatayu was nothing but a waypoint, a place the ships of humans had to go through to get to places they wanted to go.<br><br> But one day some humans came to stay. They brought a small outpost that they placed in orbit about the white dwarf star and claimed ownership of Jatayu.<br><br> Billions of years after its birth, war followed humanity to the small, bright star.<br><br> �Leaving jump space at Jatayu in five . . . four . . . three . . .�<br><br> Commodore Erik Hopkins, formerly of Earth Fleet, braced himself for the familiar disorientation and dizziness that accompanied a drop out of jump space. He wasn't otherwise worried. Freedom of Space Navigation Operation. There was a checklist for that, and every item had been checked off. The destroyer Claymore, originally known as the Garibaldi when she was part of Earth Fleet, was at Standard Alert Condition Two, just as mandated by the checklist. The freighter they were escorting would come out of jump space behind Claymore, and they would proceed through Jatayu Star System, breaking the unofficial blockade of Glenlyon Star System. It had all been planned out.<br><br> Scatha Star System had claimed control of Jatayu, a claim without legal merit but one that Scatha might try to enforce against any unescorted freighter. With other star systems within reach of Glenlyon either claimed or controlled by Scatha, or by its partners in strong-arming their neighbors, Apulu Star System and Turan Star System, trade between Glenlyon and the rest of human space had been choked off. Glenlyon faced the alternatives of either fighting or submission, but, unwilling to make that stark choice, had instead decided on trying to call what it hoped was a bluff by Scatha.<br><br> Which was where Claymore and Commodore Hopkins came in. He wasn't worried about the outcome. Earth Fleet had had a checklist for everything, and checklists for the checklists. That was how Earth Fleet got things done, and Commodore Hopkins had risen to rank by making sure he adhered to those checklists. There wasn't much left of Earth Fleet anymore, mainly the men and women still tasked with decommissioning the last remaining warships, archiving the remaining data and records, and preparing to turn out the last lights and lock the last doors. Hopkins himself, along with the great majority of the crew and the Claymore herself, had been declared surplus years ago and been forced to find new employment out among the new worlds being rapidly settled far from Earth. Glenlyon had been a decent place to work with, but Hopkins and most of the crew still thought of themselves as being from Earth rather than their new home, and Hopkins still ran everything by the rules that Earth Fleet had once lived by.<br><br> As the destroyer left jump the formless, bland gray of jump space vanished from the displays on Claymore's bridge, suddenly replaced by the familiar star-spangled black of normal space. One of those white dots was the star Jatayu itself, only a speck from the jump point five light hours away where Claymore had arrived. Velocity couldn't be measured in jump space, but back in normal space Claymore was only traveling at point zero two light speed, a crawl for a warship, because of the need to stay close to the plodding freighter she was escorting.<br><br> Dizzy from the drop out of jump space, Hopkins was still trying to focus on the display before his command seat when Claymore shuddered, then jolted as if a giant had slammed a hammer against her hull. Alarms blared throughout the ship.<br><br> "Situation!" ordered Captain Kanda Shade, commanding officer of the Claymore, as she also tried to shake off the disorientation.<br><br> "We're under attack!" the weapons watch officer reported. "Two opponents. Tentative ID-"<br><br> Claymore jerked again, hard. More alarms sounded.<br><br> "Shield failure amidships! Hull breaches in two compartments!"<br><br> Hopkins finally forced his eyes into focus, staring at his display. There were the two attackers, who must have been waiting at the jump exit for Claymore. And right behind Claymore was the freighter Bruce Monroe, having just left jump space as well.<br><br> "Attackers are a Sword Class destroyer and a Founders Class destroyer."<br><br> Hopkins opened his mouth to issue an order but hesitated.<br><br> The relevant checklists had automatically appeared on his display. When Attacked By Superior Numbers, the first item demanded "Accelerate at Full." But the list for Freedom of Navigation Operations had a block for "Maintain Close Escort of Freighter(s)." One list demanded that he order Claymore to accelerate at full, but the other demanded that he stay close to the Bruce Monroe.<br><br> Claymore jerked again.<br><br> "Another hit amidships! We've lost Particle Cannon One!"<br><br> "Shields at full!" Commander Shade ordered from her own checklist. "Main propulsion-" She paused, staring at her display where the other two checklists offered the same incompatible choices. "Commodore?"<br><br> Hopkins shook his head, wracked by indecision. "I don't- We can't-"<br><br> Two more jolts. "Main propulsion down by thirty percent! Shields have collapsed!"<br><br> The Commodore frowned at his display. Follow the checklists. He knew he had to follow the checklists. "We have to . . ." He looked helplessly at Shade. "Captain . . . ?"<br><br> Shade shook her head, baffled. "We're supposed to . . ."<br><br> Claymore groaned and shook as more blows landed. The lights went out, replaced by the dimmer glow of emergency lanterns. "Grapeshot launchers disabled. Particle Cannon Two destroyed! Serious structural damage amidships!"<br><br> "Orders, sir?" another watch stander pleaded.<br><br> Hopkins hesitated.<br><br> Shade tried to read through both checklists again.<br><br> A shudder ran through Claymore, followed by a deep boom that rattled through the ship as she broke in two.<br><br> Hopkins felt an overwhelming sense of relief as a new checklist appeared on the emergency display that had replaced his usual one. He knew what to do. It was right there, item one on the list. "Abandon ship!"<br><br> He was still running down Preparatory-to-Abandoning-Ship items on the list when a barrage of grapeshot struck and tore through the bridge of the wreck that had once been a destroyer.<br><br> Rob Geary, Senior Dock Officer for the orbital shipyard and station that was Glenlyon�s main link with space, glared at the image of Council Member Leigh Camagan on his desk display. �The government really expects me to step up again?�<br><br> "Yes," she replied. "You came through for Glenlyon three years ago, Rob."<br><br> "What do they think I can do? Claymore was totally destroyed, I'm told, half her crew dead. I sent Hopkins a message before Claymore left, warning him that it had taken him so long to prepare for that mission that Scatha had to have plenty of advance warning. Everyone on this station seemed to know about it." Rob paused, miserable as he thought of the dead. "I wish either I'd been wrong, or Hopkins had listened. Why has Saber remained in orbit here?"<br><br> Camagan made a face. "Commander Teosig was ordered out but kept finding reasons to delay. He was fired this morning."<br><br> "He should have been fired at least a year ago! I had to work with that guy whenever Saber was in dock for refit. All he cared about was looking good to Commodore Hopkins, so he'd do his best to avoid actually doing anything that might mar his reputation. I told you all about that!"<br><br> "Yes, you did," Leigh Camagan agreed, exasperated. "And I told the rest of the council, who deferred to Commodore Hopkins, who as you say thought Commander Teosig was a perfect commanding officer. Why are you venting on me? Because I was chosen to ask you to return to service?"<br><br> Rob paused, angry with himself and with the universe. "I'm sorry. What is it the government wants me to do?" he asked again.<br><br> "Assume command of Saber and all fleet assets to defend Glenlyon."<br><br> "Saber is the only fleet asset left! Are they offering me a temporary, unofficial rank of lieutenant again?"<br><br> "Commander," Camagan replied. "Official rank of commander. And status as Commodore in charge of all fleet assets."<br><br> "They must really be scared."<br><br> "They are. Glenlyon is being choked to death by the grip that Scatha and Apulu and Turan have established over the trade routes out here. If we can't find a way to break through, Glenlyon will have no choice but to submit."<br><br> "Submit?"<br><br> Camagan's glare wasn't aimed at Rob this time. "What they did at Hesta. A so-called trade office that effectively ended up controlling not just trade but also the government."<br><br> "We came out here to be free," Rob said, feeling bleak.<br><br> "A lot of people did. But it has become obvious that others came out here to start building empires."<br><br> "What about Mele Darcy?" He owed Mele that concern after what she had done three years ago to defeat Scatha on the ground.<br><br> "We need her, too. I pushed through a vote to finally create a small Marine force to assist the fleet. Mele Darcy is being offered command of that force. It's only a Marine captain's rank, but it's official."<br><br> "Who will the Marines work for?" Rob asked, remembering some stories he had heard about the ground forces commander.<br><br> "They'll work for you. They'll be part of the fleet. You'll be in charge of Mele Darcy. I'm not sure anyone else would take that particular job."<br><br> "I need to talk to Ninja before I agree to anything."<br><br> "Of course." Leigh Camagan sighed. "Give your wife Lyn my best."<br><br> "You know Lyn is fine with you calling her Ninja. All of her friends call her that."<br><br> "I imagine that Ninja won't be feeling too friendly toward me because of this. I hope she doesn't decide to hack all of my personal data."<br><br> The walk through the orbital station to his home was short, one of the perks of being Senior Dock Officer. Usually he was happy about that, but today Rob wished he had more time to think before reaching the door to his quarters. In addition to his own name a small sign advertised Ninja IT Consulting.<br><br> Ninja, as usual, was seated before several displays as she worked. "Hey," Rob said, sitting down beside her.<br><br> "Hey, yourself." Ninja gave him a sharp look. "Don't bother summarizing your talk with Camagan."<br><br> "You listened in?"<br><br> "When the governing council makes a high priority call to my husband, I think I deserve to know what's going on."<br><br> "That call was secure. Triple encrypted," Rob pointed out.<br><br> "Oh, Rob, how many times have we gone over the secure thing? It's a myth." Ninja looked away, as if focusing on one of the displays to the other side of her. "So, you're going."<br><br> "I said I needed to talk to you before I decided."<br><br> "Nice words. You and I both know what you want to do."<br><br> "What I think I have to do," Rob said. He looked toward the door to the second bedroom. "Is Little Ninja asleep?" Even though their toddler daughter's name was Dani, she'd refused to answer to anything but Little Ninja ever since Mele Darcy had called her that about six months ago.<br><br> "Yeah. What, are you feeling a bit guilty for abandoning your family?"<br><br> "Ninja-"<br><br> "No!" She turned a furious gaze on him, a dark memory vivid in her eyes. "I've never been able to forget how I felt when everyone thought you'd died on Squall. Do you know how that felt, Rob?"<br><br> "No," he admitted, unable to meet her eyes.<br><br> "So who'd tell Little Ninja if her daddy never comes home, huh? And her Aunt Mele if something happens to her? You know how much Little Ninja loves her Aunt Mele. But that'd be my job, too, wouldn't it? And our next project?" She tapped her abdomen, where the two months of pregnancy barely showed. "Who tells that kid he'll never see his father? Is that going to be my job, too?"<br><br> He knew what was driving her anger. She was afraid for him, afraid for what might happen to him and to her and their children. She needed to vent that fear, to let him know how it was affecting her. And she was doubtless also angry that fate had once more put them in a position where she had to nurse such fears.<br><br> And having let him know, she'd probably never bring it up again. Because she knew the pressure he was under, that he'd need her support, and that arguing with fate was worse than useless.<br><br> What right did he have to put her through that? Rob bit his lip, trying to come up with words, and finally looked up at her again. "Ninja, I'd decided I should go because you, and those kids, deserved a free world to live in. I really don't want to leave. If it would hurt you that much-"<br><br> "Oh, shut up, Rob! You and I both know you have to go! Because that's the idealistic idiot that I was stupid enough to fall in love with and marry! And our kids will probably inherit your sense of duty and idealism so someday I'll have to see them off on some harebrained noble missions, too! And it'll be your fault! But you had better come back again, do you hear me? You come back, or I swear I will tell these kids that you were a fool and they should never be anything like you!"<br><br> He looked at her helplessly. "What is it you want?"<br><br> Ninja shook her head. "You figure that out for yourself."<br><br> "Do you think I want to do this?" Rob demanded. "Leave you and Little Ninja? Go out there and . . . watch men and women die because of orders I gave? Do you think I want to do that again?"<br><br> She looked at him without saying anything for a few moments. "You say their names sometimes when you're asleep. Did you know that? The names of the ones who didn't come back. I hear you say those names, and I don't know what to do." She reached out and embraced him, her arms gripping him tightly. "And then I think of Kosatka, and how many people would have died there if you weren't such an idiot. And how you got most of the crew of Squall home when it seemed hopeless. And here at Glenlyon, where Scatha would probably have been running everything by now. People like you and Mele go out and do things like this because you think you have to, and people like me and Little Ninja just hope and pray you come back each time."</p><h2>Betrayed: A House of Night Novel (House of Night Novels, 2)</h2><p><p><i>Betrayed</i>, the second installment in the bestselling House of Night series from P.

His heart sank. Emily, his troubled little sister, had been doing so well since she'd gotten the job at the Sarah Hamilton Foundation in Big Timber, Montana.<br><br>"What's wrong?" he asked as he removed his Stetson, pulled up a chair at the Big Timber Java coffee shop and sat down across from her. Tossing his hat on the seat of an adjacent chair, he braced himself for bad news.<br><br>Emily blinked her big blue eyes. Even though she was closing in on twenty-five, he often caught glimpses of the girl she'd been. Her pixie cut, once a dark brown like his own hair, was dyed black. From thirteen on, she'd been piercing anything she could. At sixteen she'd begun getting tattoos and drinking. It wasn't until she'd turned seventeen that she'd run away, taken up with a thirty-year-old biker drug-dealer thief and ended up in jail for the first time.<br><br>But while Emily still had the tattoos and the piercings, she'd changed after the birth of her daughter, and after snagging this job with Bo Hamilton.<br><br>"What's wrong is Bo," his sister said. Bo had insisted her employees at the foundation call her by her first name. "Pretty cool for a boss, huh?" his sister had said at the time. He'd been surprised. That didn't sound like the woman he knew.<br><br>But who knew what was in Bo's head lately. Four months ago her mother, Sarah, who everyone believed dead the past twenty-two years, had suddenly shown up out of nowhere. According to what he'd read in the papers, Sarah had no memory of the past twenty-two years.<br><br>He'd been worried it would hurt the foundation named for her. Not to mention what a shock it must have been for Bo.<br><br>Emily leaned toward him and whispered, "Bo's... She's gone."<br><br><em>"Gone?"</em><br><br>"Before she left Friday, she told me that she would be back by ten this morning. She hasn't shown up, and no one knows where she is."<br><br>That <em>did</em> sound like the Bo Hamilton he knew. The thought of her kicked up that old ache inside him. He'd been glad when Emily had found a job in town and moved back to town with her baby girl. But he'd often wished her employer had been anyone but Bo Hamilton&#x2014;the woman he'd once asked to marry him.<br><br>He'd spent the past five years avoiding Bo, which wasn't easy in a county as small as Sweet Grass. Crossing paths with her, even after five years, still hurt. It riled him in a way that only made him mad at himself for letting her get to him after all this time.<br><br>"What do you mean, gone?" he asked now.<br><br>Emily looked pained. "I probably shouldn't be telling you this&#x2014;"<br><br>"Em," he said impatiently. She'd been doing so well at this job, and she'd really turned her life around. He couldn't bear the thought that Bo's disappearance might derail her second chance. Em's three-year-old daughter, Jodie, desperately needed her mom to stay on track.<br><br>Leaning closer again, she whispered, "Apparently there are funds missing from the foundation. An auditor's been going over all the records since Friday."<br><br>He sat back in surprise. No matter what he thought of Bo, he'd never imagined this. The woman was already rich. She wouldn't need to divert funds...<br><br>"And that's not the worst of it," Emily said. "I was told she's on a camping trip in the mountains."<br><br>"So, she isn't really gone."<br><br>Em waved a hand. "She took her camping gear, saddled up and left Saturday afternoon. Apparently she's the one who called the auditor, so she knew he would be finished and wanting to talk to her this morning!"<br><br>Jace considered this news. If Bo really were on the run with the money, wouldn't she take her passport and her SUV as far as the nearest airport? But why would she run at all? He doubted Bo had ever had a problem that her daddy, the senator, hadn't fixed for her. She'd always had a safety net. Unlike him.<br><br>He'd been on his own since eighteen. He'd been a senior in high school, struggling to pay the bills, hang on to the ranch and raise his wild kid sister after his parents had been killed in a small plane crash. He'd managed to save the ranch, but he hadn't been equipped to raise Emily and had made his share of mistakes.<br><br>A few months ago, his sister had gotten out of jail and gone to work for Bo. He'd been surprised she'd given Emily a chance. He'd had to readjust his opinion of Bo&#x2014;but only a little. Now this.<br><br>"There has to be an explanation," he said, even though he knew firsthand that Bo often acted impulsively. She did whatever she wanted, damn the world. But now his little sister was part of that world. How could she leave Emily and the rest of the staff at the foundation to face this alone?<br><br>"I sure hope everything is all right," his sister said. "Bo is so sweet."<br><br><em>Sweet</em> wasn't a word he would have used to describe her. Sexy in a cowgirl way, yes, since most of the time she dressed in jeans, boots and a Western shirt&#x2014;all of which accented her very nice curves. Her long, sandyblond hair was often pulled up in a ponytail or wrestled into a braid that hung over one shoulder. Since her wide green eyes didn't need makeup to give her that girl-next-door look, she seldom wore it.<br><br>"I can't believe she wouldn't show up. Something must have happened," Emily said loyally.<br><br>He couldn't help being skeptical based on Bo's history. But given Em's concern, he didn't want to add his own kindling to the fire.<br><br>"Jace, I just have this bad feeling. You're the best tracker in these parts. I know it's a lot to ask, but would you go find her?"<br><br>He almost laughed. Given the bad blood between him and Bo? "I'm the last person&#x2014;"<br><br>"I'm really worried about her. I know she wouldn't run off."<br><br>Jace wished <em>he</em> knew that. "Look, if you're really that concerned, maybe you should call the sheriff. He can get search and rescue&#x2014;"<br><br>"No," Emily cried. "No one knows what's going on over at the foundation. We have to keep this quiet. That's why you have to go."<br><br>He'd never been able to deny his little sister anything, but this was asking too much. "Please, Jace."<br><br>He swore silently. Maybe he'd get lucky and Bo would return before he even got saddled up. "If you're that worried..." He got to his feet and reached for his hat, telling himself it shouldn't take him long to find Bo if she'd gone up into the Crazies, as the Crazy Mountains were known locally. He'd grown up in those mountains. His father had been an avid hunter who'd taught him everything about mountain survival.<br><br>If Bo had gone rogue with the foundation's funds... He hated to think what that would do not only to Emily's job but also to her recovery. She idolized her boss. So did Jodie, who was allowed the run of the foundation office.<br><br>But finding Bo was one thing. Bringing her back to face the music might be another. He started to say as much to Emily, but she cut him off.<br><br>"Oh, Jace, thank you so much. If anyone can find her, it's you."<br><br>He smiled at his sister as he set his Stetson firmly on his head and made her a promise. "I'll find Bo Hamilton and bring her back." One way or the other.<br><br><strong><em>CHAPTER TWO</em></strong><br><br>Bo Hamilton rose with the sun, packed up camp and saddled up as a squirrel chattered at her from a nearby pine tree. Overhead, high in the Crazy Mountains, Montana's big, cloudless early summer sky had turned a brilliant blue. The day was already warm. Before she'd left, she'd heard a storm was coming in, but she'd known she'd be out of the mountains long before it hit.<br><br>She'd had a devil of a time getting to sleep last night, and after tossing and turning for hours in her sleeping bag, she had finally fallen into a death-like sleep.<br><br>But this morning, she'd awakened ready to face whatever would be awaiting her back at the office in town. Coming up here in the mountains had been the best thing she could have done. For months she'd been worried and confused as small amounts of money kept disappearing from the foundation.<br><br>Then last week, she'd realized that more than a hundred thousand dollars was gone. She'd been so shocked that she hadn't been able to breathe, let alone think. That's when she'd called in an independent auditor. She just hoped she could find out what had happened to the money before anyone got wind of it&#x2014;especially her father, Senator Buckmaster Hamilton.<br><br>Her stomach roiled at the thought. He'd always been so proud of her for taking over the reins of the foundation that bore her mother's name. All her father needed was another scandal. He was running for the presidency of the United States, something he'd dreamed of for years. Now his daughter was about to go to jail for embezzlement. She could only imagine his disappointment in her&#x2014;not to mention what it might do to the foundation.<br><br>She loved the work the foundation did, helping small businesses in their community. Her father had been worried that she couldn't handle the responsibility. She'd been determined to show him he was wrong. And show herself, as well. She'd grown up a lot in the past five years, and running the foundation had given her a sense of purpose she'd badly needed.<br><br>That's why she was anxious to find out the results of the audit now that her head was clear. The mountains always did that for her. Breathing in the fresh air now, she swung up in the saddle, spurred her horse and headed down the trail toward the ranch. She'd camped only a couple of hours back into the mountain, so she still had plenty of time, she thought as she rode. The last thing she wanted was to be late to meet with the auditor.<br><br>She'd known for some time that there were... <em>discrepancies</em> in foundation funds. A part of her had hoped that it was merely a mistake&#x2014;that someone would realize he or she had made an error&#x2014;so she wouldn't have to confront anyone about the slip.<br><br>Bo knew how naive that was, but she couldn't bear to think that one of her employees was behind the theft. Yes, her employees were a ragtag bunch. There was Albert Drum, a seventy-two-year-young former banker who worked with the recipients of the foundation loans. Emily Calder, twenty-four, took care of the website, research, communication and marketing. The only other employee was forty-eight-year-old widower Norma Branstetter, who was in charge of fund-raising.<br><br>Employees and board members reviewed the applications that came in for financial help. But Bo was the one responsible for the money that came and went through the foundation.<br><br>Unfortunately, she trusted her employees so much that she often let them run the place, including dealing with the financial end of things. She hadn't been paying close enough attention. How else could there be unexplained expenditures?<br><br>Her father had warned her about the people she hired, saying she had to be careful. But she loved giving jobs to those who desperately needed another chance. Her employees had become a second family to her.<br><br>Just the thought that one of her employees might be responsible made her sick to her stomach. True, she was a sucker for a hard-luck story. But she trusted the people she'd hired. The thought brought tears to her eyes. They all tried so hard and were so appreciative of their jobs. She refused to believe any one of them would steal from the foundation.<br><br>So what had happened to the missing funds?<br><br>She hadn't ridden far when her horse nickered and raised his head as if sniffing the wind. Spurring him forward, she continued through the dense trees. The pine boughs sighed in the breeze, releasing the smells of early summer in the mountains she'd grown up with. She loved the Crazy Mountains. She loved them especially at this time of year. They rose from the valley into high snowcapped peaks, the awe-inspiring range running for miles to the north like a mountainous island in a sea of grassy plains.<br><br>What she appreciated most about the Crazies was that a person could get lost in them, she thought. A hunter had done just that last year.<br><br>She'd ridden down the ridge some distance, the sun moving across the sky over her head, before she caught the strong smell of smoke. This morning she'd put her campfire out using the creek water nearby. Too much of Montana burned every summer because of lightning storms and careless people, so she'd made sure her fire was extinguished before she'd left.<br><br>Now reining in, she spotted the source of the smoke. A small campfire burned below her in the dense trees of a protected gully. She stared down into the camp as smoke curled up. While it wasn't that unusual to stumble across a backpacker this deep in the Crazies, it <em>was</em> strange for a camp to be so far off the trail. Also, she didn't see anyone below her on the mountain near the fire. Had whoever had camped there failed to put out the fire before leaving?<br><br>Bo hesitated, feeling torn because she didn't want to take the time to ride all the way down the mountain to the out-of-the-way camp. Nor did she want to ride into anyone's camp unless necessary.<br><br>But if the camper had failed to put out the fire, that was another story.<br><br>"Hello?" she called down the mountainside.<br><br>A hawk let out a cry overhead, momentarily startling her.<br><br>"Hello?" she called again, louder.<br><br>No answer. No sign of anyone in the camp.<br><br>Bo let out an aggravated sigh and spurred her horse.<br><br>She had a long ride back and didn't need a detour. But she still had plenty of time if she hurried. As she made her way down into the ravine, she caught glimpses of the camp and the smoking campfire, but nothing else.<br><br>The hidden-away camp finally came into view below her. She could see that whoever had camped there hadn't made any effort at all to put out the fire. She looked for horseshoe tracks but saw only boot prints in the dust that led down to the camp.<br><br>A quiet seemed to fall over the mountainside. No hawk called out again from high above the trees. No squirrel chattered at her from a pine bough. Even the breeze seemed to have gone silent.<br><br>Bo felt a sudden chill as if the sun had gone down&#x2014;an instant before the man appeared so suddenly from out of the dense darkness of the trees. He grabbed her, yanked her down from the saddle and clamped an arm around her as he shoved the dirty blade of a knife in her face.<br><br>"Well, look at you," he said hoarsely against her ear. "Ain't you a sight for sore eyes? Guess it's my lucky day."</p><h2>Alpine Climbing: Techniques to Take You Higher (Mountaineers Outdoor Expert)</h2><p>* For climbers who know the basics and are ready to venture higher<br> * Written by longtime guides and climbing instructors certified by the American Mountain Guide Association (AMGA)<br> * Teaches situational thinking and learning as well as technique <p></p> This intermediate-level guide addresses tools, skills, and techniques used in alpine <p></p> terrain including rock, snow, ice, and glaciers at moderate altitude-approximately 5000 meters (16,000 feet) and lower. The technical protection systems are covered, of course. But 30 years of alpine climbing experience has convinced the authors that mastery-and safety-lie in the far more difficult task of knowing exactly which techniques to use, where and when. Therefore, they teach step-by-step decision-making skills, providing scenarios, checklists, and self-posed questions to inform the decision process. <p></p> Alpine Climbing assumes some prior knowledge, primarily in rock climbing skills and techniques. Basic knots, belaying, rappelling, building rock anchors, leading, placing rock protection, and movement skills on rock: variations of these skills that are of particular value in the alpine environment are addressed in this book. <p></p> Kathy Cosley and Mark Houston have been guides and climbing instructors for more than 20 years.

Whether meditating upon a button, the role of habit in our lives, or the elusive nature of our relationship to sleep, Hirshfield brings each subject into a surprising and magnified existence.</p></p><p><p>The author of five previous poetry collections and a book of essays, Jane Hirshfield has been a finalist for both the National Book Critics Circle Award and England&#x2019;s T. S. Eliot Prize for Poetry, and she is the winner of the Poetry Center Book Award, the California Book Award, and fellowships from the Academy of American Poets, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Guggenheim and Rockefeller foundations. Her work has appeared in <em>The New Yorker</em>, <em>Atlantic Monthly</em>, <em>The Nation</em>, the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, and multiple volumes of <em>The Best American Poetry</em> and <em>Pushcart Prize</em> anthologies.</p>Celebrated as an anthologist (Women in Praise of the Sacred, etc.), Hirshfeld seeks wisdom in the introspective occasions everyday life provides for this fifth collection. As in The October Palace, Hirshfeld's stripped-down diction and hushed sentences attend to her speaker's psychic losses and transformations: "For a year I watched/ as something--terror? happiness? grief?--/ entered and then left my body." "Dream Notebook" wrests a new-seeming subject from an old lyric quarry--not our dreams, but the way we forget them--while other poems consider household objects ("Pillow," "Ladder") in novel ways. Hirshfeld, who has also published a prose work on religion and poetry, uses Buddhism to inform a number of moving, straightforward lyrics and verse-essays (on "Clocks," "Ink," and "Sleep"). Elsewhere poems appeal to autobiography ("I, a woman of forty-five, beginning to gray at the temples") or take up, along with the speaker's overt self-consciousness, the powers and limits of poetry: "Does a poem enlarge the world,/ or only our idea of the world?"; "Why is it so difficult to speak simply?" A few such questions can go a long way, and Hirshfeld relies on their diffuse power too often: this long book of short poems might have been better shorter. A more serious flaw is Hirshfeld's dependence on Louise Gl ck's characteristic modes: the chilly, interior inquiries and flat declarations will seem very, very familiar to the latter's readers. Yet if Hirshfeld rarely surpasses her model, she uses it well: always accessible and on occasion profound, her new work will likely add to her large circle of admirers. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Crystal Prescriptions: Crystal Solutions to Electromagnetic Pollution and Geopathic Stress An A-Z Guide (Volume 3) (Crystal Prescriptions, 3)</h2><p>This third A&#x2013;Z directory by the author of The Crystal Bibles explores the effects of electromagnetic field (EMF) pollution and geopathic stress (GS) on health and well-being, and the dis-eases and healing crystals associated with them.

Now Marcy's shop has become a crime scene, and she's the prime suspect.

No sooner does Marcy take over retail space formerly occupied by a hardware store that she discovers the dead body of the previous tenant, Tim Enright, in her storeroom. Even though at first glance there's no evidence of foul play, both she and local detective Ted Nash suspect otherwise. Adding to the mystery is a cryptic unfinished message Enright had scratched on the storeroom wall before he died. The clues are gauzy thin and soon a second murder makes everyone a potential suspect. Fans of the genre will take kindly to Marcy, her Irish wolfhound, Angus O'Ruff, and Tallulah Falls. This is a fast, pleasant read with prose full of pop culture references and, of course, sharp needlework puns. (Aug.) <br>(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

Paintings throughout Christian times picture St. Jerome with the grateful lion at his feet. Hodges, using Renaissance interpretations of the legend that show the saint with a dog and donkey, as well as the lion, has shaped a story that includes all three animals. The rescued lion, set to the task of guarding the donkey, fails to keep him safe from thieves. The monks who surround the blessed saint speak out against the lion, but kindly Jerome defends him. The lion gives up his favored place in St. Jerome's study to the dog and takes on the domestic role of donkey, becoming a beast of burden. One day the thieves return with their caravan, led by the donkey. The lion is redeemed, the donkey is returned, and the wisdom of Jerome restores peace and justice to the community of men and animals. A moral tale, handsomely illustrated with Moser's dramatically highlighted, dark-shadowed watercolors, this gentle story is well suited to church libraries and to situations in which the values of trust and kindness and "innocent until proven guilty" are to be discussed. --Shirley Wilton, Ocean County College, Toms River, NJ<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.This medieval legend of the early monk who lived in Bethlehem and translated the Bible into Latin is such a wonderful story that it's surprising it hasn't been retold more often. Like Androcles, Jerome makes friends with a lion by removing a thorn from his paw. The lion stays on, his task to keep watch over the monastery donkey. Then the donkey disappears. The other monks think the lion has eaten it, but Jerome refuses to condemn him; instead, he asks the lion to do the donkey's work. Eventually, the lion finds the donkey and brings it home--together with the camels belonging to the merchants who stole it. The tale's essential harmony shines in Hodges's graceful narrative, Jerome's patient wisdom counterpointed by the quiet interplay among donkey, lion, and a jealous dog that also learns to accept the lion. Moser's elegant design, featuring a taste of exquisite calligraphy and austere rule in brilliant red, provides the perfect setting for his marvelously expressive watercolors: intense portraits of the contemplative saint; beautifully understated night scenes in shades of blue; the awe-inspiring lion, noble, fierce, yet tender. Luminous and altogether splendid. (Folklore/Picture book. 4+) -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

He studied at the University of Kazan, then led a life of pleasure until 1851 when he joined an artillery regiment in the Caucasus. He established his reputation as a writer with The Sebastopol Sketches (1855-6). After a period in St Petersburg and abroad, he married, had thirteen children, managed his vast estates in the Volga Steppes and wrote War and Peace (1869) and Anna Karenina (1877). A Confession (1879-82) marked a spiritual crisis in his life, and in 1901 he was excommuincated by the Russian Holy Synod.

"Ivan Ilyich is dead." <br><br>"Really?" <br><br>"Here, read this," he said to Fyodor Vasilyevich, handing him the fresh issue, still smelling of printer's ink. <br><br>Framed in black was the following announcement: "With profound sorrow Praskovya Fyodorovna Golovina informs relatives and acquaintances that her beloved husband, Ivan Ilyich Golovin, Member of the Court of Justice, passed away on the 4th of February, 1882. The funeral will be held on Friday at one o'clock." <br><br>Ivan Ilyich had been a colleague of the gentlemen assembled here and they had all been fond of him. He had been ill for some weeks and his disease was said to be incurable. His post had been kept open for him, but it had been speculated that in the event of his death Alekseev might be appointed to his place and either Vinnikov or Shtabel succeed Alekseev. And so the first thought that occurred to each of the gentlemen in this office, learning of Ivan Ilyich's death, was what effect it would have on their own transfers and promotions or those of their acquaintances. <br><br>"Now I'm sure to get Shtabel's post or Vinnikov's," thought Fyodor Vasilyevich. "It was promised to me long ago, and the promotion will mean an increase of eight hundred rubles in salary plus an allowance for office expenses." <br><br>"I must put in a request to have my brother-in-law transferred from Kaluga," thought Pyotr Ivanovich. "My wife will be very happy. Now she won't be able to say I never do anything for her family." <br><br>"I had a feeling he'd never get over it," said Pyotr Ivanovich. "Sad." <br><br>"What, exactly, was the matter with him?" <br><br>"The doctors couldn't decide. That is, they decided, but in different ways. When I last saw him, I thought he would recover." <br><br>"And I haven't been there since the holidays. I kept meaning to go." <br><br>"Was he a man of any means?" <br><br>"His wife has a little something, I think, but nothing much." <br><br>"Well, there's no question but that we'll have to go and see her. They live so terribly far away." <br><br>"From you, that is. From your place, everything's far away." <br><br>"You see, he just can't forgive me for living on the other side of the river," said Pyotr Ivanovich, smiling at Shebek. And with that they began talking about relative distances in town and went back to the courtroom. <br><br>In addition to the speculations aroused in each man's mind about the transfers and likely job changes this death might occasion, the very fact of the death of a close acquaintance evoked in them all the usual feeling of relief that it was someone else, not they, who had died. <br><br>"Well, isn't that something--he's dead, but I'm not," was what each of them thought or felt. The closer acquaintances, the so-called friends of Ivan Ilyich, involuntarily added to themselves that now they had to fulfill the tedious demands of propriety by attending the funeral service and paying the widow a condolence call. <br><br>Fyodor Vasilyevich and Pyotr Ivanovich had been closest to him. Pyotr Ivanovich had studied law with Ivan Ilyich and considered himself indebted to him. At dinner that evening he told his wife the news of Ivan Ilyich's death, conjectured about the possibility of having her brother transferred to their district, and then, dispensing with his usual nap, he put on a dress coat and drove to Ivan Ilyich's home. <br><br>A carriage and two cabs were parked before the entrance. Downstairs in the hallway, next to the coat stand, a coffin lid decorated with silk brocade, tassels, and highly polished gilt braid was propped against the wall. Two women in black were taking off their fur coats. One of them he recognized as Ivan Ilyich's sister; the other was a stranger. Schwartz, his colleague, was just starting down the stairs, but on seeing Pyotr Ivanovich enter, he paused at the top step and winked at him as if to say: "Ivan Ilyich has really bungled--not the sort of thing you and I would do." <br><br>There was, as usual, an air of elegant solemnity about Schwartz, with his English side-whiskers and his lean figure in a dress coat, and this solemnity, always such a marked contrast to his playful personality, had a special piquancy here. So, at least, Pyotr Ivanovich thought. <br><br>Pyotr Ivanovich stepped aside to let the ladies pass and slowly followed them up the stairs. Schwartz did not proceed downward but remained on the landing. Pyotr Ivanovich understood why; obviously, he wanted to arrange where they should play whist that evening. The ladies went upstairs to the widow's quarters, while Schwartz, his lips compressed into a serious expression and his eyes gleaming playfully, jerked his brows to the right to indicate the room where the dead man lay. <br><br>Pyotr Ivanovich went in bewildered, as people invariably are, about what he was expected to do there. The one thing he knew was that on such occasions it never did any harm to cross oneself. He was not quite certain whether he ought also to bow and so he adopted a middle course: on entering the room he began to cross himself and make a slight movement resembling a bow. At the same time, to the extent that the motions of his hands and head permitted, he glanced about the room. Two young people, apparently nephews, one of them a gymnasium student, were crossing themselves as they left the room. An old woman was standing motionless. And a lady with peculiarly arched brows was whispering something to her. A church reader in a frock coat--a vigorous, resolute fellow--was reading something in a loud voice and in a tone that brooked no contradiction. The pantry boy, Gerasim, stepped lightly in front of Pyotr Ivanovich, sprinkling something about the floor. Seeing this, Pyotr Ivanovich immediately became aware of a faint odor of decomposition. On his last visit Pyotr Ivanovich had seen this peasant boy in Ivan Ilyich's study; he had acted as a sick nurse to the dying man and Ivan Ilyich had been particularly fond of him. <br><br>Pyotr Ivanovich went on crossing himself and bowing slightly in a direction midway between the coffin, the church reader, and the icons on a table in the corner. Then, when he felt he had overdone the crossing, he paused and began to examine the dead man. <br><br>The body lay, as the dead invariably do, in a peculiarly heavy manner, with its rigid limbs sunk into the bedding of the coffin and its head eternally bowed on the pillow, exhibiting, as do all dead bodies, a yellow waxen forehead (with bald patches gleaming on the sunken temples), the protruding nose beneath seeming to press down against the upper lip. Ivan Ilyich had changed a great deal, grown even thinner since Pyotr Ivanovich had last seen him, and yet, as with all dead men, his face had acquired an expression of greater beauty--above all, of greater significance--than it had in life. Its expression implied that what needed to be done had been done and done properly. Moreover, there was in this expression a reproach or a reminder to the living. This reminder seemed out of place to Pyotr Ivanovich, or at least inapplicable to him. He began to feel somewhat uncomfortable and so he crossed himself hurriedly (all too hurriedly, he felt, from the standpoint of propriety), turned, and headed for the door. <br><br>In the adjoining room Schwartz was waiting for him, his feet planted solidly apart, his hands toying with the top hat he held behind his back. One glance at his playful, well-groomed, elegant figure was enough to revive Pyotr Ivanovich. He felt that Schwartz was above all this and would not succumb to mournful impressions. His very appearance seemed to say: "In no way can the incident of this funeral service for Ivan Ilyich be considered sufficient grounds for canceling the regular session; that is, nothing can prevent us from meeting tonight and flipping through a new deck of cards while a footman places four fresh candles around the table. There is, in fact, no reason to assume this incident can keep us from spending a pleasant evening." And he said as much to Pyotr Ivanovich in a whisper, proposing they meet for a game at Fyodor Vasilyevich's. <br><br>But Pyotr Ivanovich was not destined to play cards that evening. Praskovya Fyodorovna, a short, stocky woman (far broader at the hips than at the shoulders, despite all her efforts to the contrary), dressed all in black, with a lace shawl on her head and with the same peculiarly arched brows as the woman facing the coffin, emerged from her chambers with some other ladies whom she showed to the door of the room where the dead man lay, and said: "The service is about to begin, do go in." <br><br>Schwartz made a vague sort of bow, then stopped, neither accepting nor rejecting the invitation. Recognizing Pyotr Ivanovich, Praskovya Fyodorovna sighed, went right up to him, took his hand, and said: "I know you were a true friend of Ivan Ilyich's . . ." and looked at him, awaiting a fitting response. Pyotr Ivanovich knew that just as he had to cross himself in there, here he had to press her hand, sigh, and say: "I assure you!" And so he did. And having done so felt he had achieved the desired effect: he was touched and so was she. <br><br>"Come, before it begins, I must have a talk with you," said the widow. "Give me your arm." <br><br>He gave her his arm and they proceeded toward the inner rooms, past Schwartz, who threw Pyotr Ivanovich a wink of regret that said: "So much for your card game. Don't be offended if we find another player. Perhaps you can make a fifth when you get away." <br><br>Pyotr Ivanovich sighed even more deeply and plaintively, and Praskovya Fyodorovna squeezed his hand gratefully. On entering her drawing room, decorated in pink cretonne and lit with a dim lamp, they sat down beside a table: she on a sofa, Pyotr Ivanovich on a low ottoman with broken springs that shifted under his weight. Praskovya Fyodorovna wanted to warn him against sitting there but felt such a warning was not in keeping with her situation and decided against it. As he sat down on the ottoman Pyotr Ivanovich recalled how, in decorating the room, Ivan Ilyich had consulted him about this pink cretonne with the green leaves. The whole room was crammed with furniture and knick-knacks, and as the widow stepped past the table to seat herself on the sofa, she entangled the lace of her black shawl in a bit of carving. Pyotr Ivanovich rose slightly to untangle it, and as he did the springs of the ottoman, freed of pressure, surged and gave him a little shove. The widow started to disentangle the lace herself and Pyotr Ivanovich sat down again, suppressing the rebellious springs beneath him. But the widow had not fully disentangled herself and Pyotr Ivanovich rose once again, and again the ottoman rebelled and even creaked. When all this was over, the widow took out a clean cambric handkerchief and began to weep. The episode with the lace and the battle with the ottoman had chilled Pyotr Ivanovich's emotions and he sat there scowling. The strain of the situation was broken when Sokolov, Ivan Ilyich's footman, came to report that the plot Praskovya Fyodorovna had selected in the cemetery would cost two hundred rubles. She stopped weeping and, glancing at Pyotr Ivanovich with a victimized air, told him in French how hard this was for her. He responded with a silent gesture indicating he had no doubt this was so. <br><br>"Please feel free to smoke," she said in a magnanimous yet crushed tone of voice and turned to Sokolov to discuss the price of the grave. As he lit his cigarette Pyotr Ivanovich heard her make detailed inquiries about the prices of various plots and arrive at a very sound decision. Moreover, when she had settled that matter, she made arrangements about the choristers. Then Sokolov left. <br><br>"I attend to everything myself," she said to Pyotr Ivanovich, moving aside some albums on the table. And noticing that the ashes of his cigarette were in danger of falling on the table, she quickly passed him an ashtray and said: "I believe it would be sheer pretense for me to say that I am unable, because of grief, to attend to practical matters. On the contrary, if anything can . . . I won't say console but . . . distract me, it is seeing to all these things about him." Again she took out a handkerchief as if about to weep but suddenly seemed to have mastered her emotion, and with a little toss of her head she began to speak calmly. <br><br>"But there is a matter I wish to discuss with you." <br><br>Pyotr Ivanovich bowed his head in response, taking care not to allow the springs of the ottoman, which immediately grew restive, to have their way. <br><br>"He suffered terribly the last few days." <br><br>"Did he?" asked Pyotr Ivanovich. <br><br>"Oh, frightfully! He screamed incessantly, not for minutes but for hours on end. He screamed for three straight days without pausing for breath. It was unbearable. I don't know how I bore up through it all. You could hear him three rooms away. Oh, what I've been through!" <br><br>"And was he really conscious through it all?" asked Pyotr Ivanovich. <br><br>"Yes," she whispered, "to the very last. He took leave of us a quarter of an hour before he died and even asked us to take Volodya away." <br><br>Despite a distasteful awareness of his own hypocrisy as well as hers, Pyotr Ivanovich was overcome with horror as he thought of the suffering of someone he had known so well, first as a carefree boy, then as a schoolmate, later as a grown man, his colleague. Once again he saw that forehead, that nose pressing down on the upper lip, and fear for himself took possession of him. <br><br>"Three days of terrible suffering and death. Why, the same thing could happen to me at anytime now," he thought and for a moment felt panic-stricken. But at once, he himself did not know how, he was rescued by the customary reflection that all this had happened to Ivan Ilyich, not to him, that it could not and should not happen to him; and that if he were to grant such a possibility, he would succumb to depression which, as Schwartz's expression had made abundantly clear, he ought not to do. With this line of reasoning Pyotr Ivanovich set his mind at rest and began to press for details about Ivan Ilyich's death, as though death were a chance experience that could happen only to Ivan Ilyich, never to himself.</p><h2>Foundations of Aerodynamics: Bases of Aerodynamic Design</h2><p>Like previous editions, this text has retained it&#39;s excellent coverage of basic concepts and broad coverage of the major aspects of aerodynamics.

The author uses real examples from gardens he has designed, constructed, and photographed to illustrate his key points, approaching each work from the perspective of the home or building owner.<br>Oguchi begins with front gardens, as these are usually what one encounters first when entering a home. Typically, these front plantings are not defined Japanese garden types but rather, physical areas. He then moves on to tsubo niwa (courtyard gardens) and kare sansui (dry gardens) that might be found in the middle or rear of a building, or any available small space. Next, he introduces tea and tree gardens, which are more likely to be sections of a larger garden; and highlights specific characteristics and conditions of interior gardens.<br>Within each chapter are general layouts and methods of developing the various gardens, which precede specific, step-by-step instructions. The author also offers practical and affordable variations on more ambitious designs and shows how they can be adapted to the reader&#x2019;s home or building. In addition, Oguchi emphasizes the importance of proper maintenance and offers suggestions for special touches and restoration.</p><p><b>MOTOMI OGUCHI</b> was born in 1947. Since he began his career as a garden designer, he has created about 400 Japanese gardens for homes, temples, and public buildings including the Schloss Schoenbrunn in Vienna and his current project, the Shizen-An spa/retreat on the north fork of Long Island, NY.<br>His co-author, <b>JOSEPH CALI</b>, wrote The New Zen Garden published by Kodansha International.Oguchi, longtime designer of Japanese gardens and author of more than 18 books on the subject in Japanese, offers English speakers both an overview and practical knowledge of this easily recognized but to many Westerners mysterious art form. Oguchi describes the Japanese garden's relation to architecture from the ancient era to the mid&#x2013;19th century, tracing its evolution from the lavish hills, ponds and waterfalls of early estates to the inward-turning, abbreviated and abstracted gardens of urban townhouses. He calls the guidelines of Japanese garden design naturalness, studied tastefulness, and harmony, tempered by flexibility for site conditions, current needs and desires, and self-expression, and presents essential design devices such as asymmetry, <i>miekakure</i> (hide and reveal). Most of the book gives concrete details on how to design and build a garden for the home or small business, using as examples the author's designs for restaurants, homes and his traditional teahouse. With precise instructions and illustrations for building typical elements such as bamboo fences and stone bridges, the book gives Americans all the information they need to create authentic Japanese gardens. The lack of a glossary may make it hard for readers to retain meanings of the many Japanese terms strewn throughout the text. <i>(Aug.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This "standard formula" works for some people but leaves most of us feeling disengaged and frustrated. As much as we might dislike the standard formula, it seems like there's no other practical path to financial security and a fulfilling life. But what if there is? </p><p>In the Dark Horse Project at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, bestselling author and acclaimed thought leader Todd Rose and neuroscientist Ogi Ogas studied women and men who achieved impressive success even though nobody saw them coming. Dark horses blaze their own trail to a life of happiness and prosperity. Yet what is so remarkable is that hidden inside their seemingly one-of-a-kind journeys are practical principles for achieving success that work for anyone, no matter who you are or what you hope to achieve. This mold-breaking approach doesn't depend on you SAT scores, who you know, or how much money you have. The secret is a mindset that can be expressed in plain English: Harness your individuality in the pursuit of fulfillment to achieve excellence. </p><p>In <em><strong>Dark Horse</strong></em>, Rose and Ogas show how the four elements of the dark horse mindset empower you to consistently make the right choices that fit your unique interests, abilities, and circumstances and will guide you to a life of passion, purpose, and achievement. </p></p><p><p>Todd Rose is the director of the Mind, Brain, and Education program at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, where he leads the Laboratory for the Science of Individuality.

He finds an answer in a political Left that shares a view of America as the "Great Satan" with America&#x2019;s radical Islamic enemies. This Left, which once made common cause with Communists, has now joined forces with radical Islam in attacking America&#x2019;s defenses at home and its policies abroad. From their positions of influence in the university and media culture, leftists have defined America as the "root cause" of the attacks against it. In a remarkable exploration of the "Mind of the Left," Horowitz traces the evolution of American radicalism from its Communist past to its "anti-war" present. He then shows how this Left was able to turn the Democratic Party presidential campaign around and reshape its views on the War on Terror. <p> Horowitz&#x2019;s Unholy Alliance, writes John Haynes, the noted historian of American Communism, "is an insightful, brilliant examination of the mental world of the radical left. Horowitz shows how today&#x2019;s radicals, unwilling to reflect on the internal flaws that destroyed Marxism-Leninism from within, have embraced an all-consuming nihilism in its place. This has led them to a hatred of American institutions and a solidarity with Islamic terrorists that makes the radical left more properly regarded as dangerous than loony." </p><p> Unholy Alliance is an eye-opening book that should unsettle conventional assumptions and reveals why intellectuals and political leaders who applaud Michael Moore are no laughing matter. As Harvey Klehr, author of Venona: Decoding Soviet Espionage in America, writes, "The world Communist movement may be moribund, but its habits of mind and ideological fantasies have not disappeared. This is a fascinating and depressing account."</p>David Horowitz is a nationally known author and lifelong civil rights activist. He was one of the founders of the New Left movement in the 1960s. He has written numerous books, including The Politics of Bad Faith, The Art of Political War, and Radical Son, his celebrated autobiography.

Their strange behavior&#x2014;eating meals at their desks, not completing reading assignments, remaining silent through class discussions&#x2014;made her feel as if she were dealing with a completely foreign culture. So Nathan decided to do what anthropologists do when confused by a different culture: Go live with them. She enrolled as a freshman, moved into the dorm, ate in the dining hall, and took a full load of courses. And she came to understand that being a student is a pretty difficult job, too. Her discoveries about contemporary undergraduate culture are surprising and her observations are invaluable, making <b>My Freshman Year</b> essential reading for students, parents, faculty, and anyone interested in educational policy.</p><p>"This volume is a page-turner from beginning to end. Rebekah Nathan reveals how little intellectual life matters in college and explores the lives of students who are enveloped by notions of individualism, choice, and materialism. Traversing topics as far ranging as friendship, social life, engagement in university classrooms, dorm life, and the experiences of racial and ethnic minorities as well as those of an increasingly growing number of international students, Nathan uses her well-honed anthropological skills to study the 'university as village.' Faculty, students, and parents alike will find this volume illuminating as we get 'up close and personal' with those undergraduates who attend our large state institutions."&#x2014;Lois Weis, author of Class Reunion: The Remaking of the American White Working Class <p>"This is an outstanding book, one of the most important books I've read in this century, and I know it will transform and inspire my teaching and writing. Rebekah Nathan's project--to go undercover as a college student, living in a dorm--is bold and intriguing, especially for a woman anthropologist in her fifties. She comes back with a fascinating story of students who are frazzled but astute at working the system in a world that's invisible to most university faculty. This memoir reveals secrets and solves many a mystery, such as--Why do so many students ignore reading assignments? Why are Friday classes usually disasters? What makes students reluctant to take part in class discussion? Why don't most college students discuss ideas outside of class? And how are international students surprised and sometimes horrified by the behavior of American undergraduates? This book is notable for its ethical treatment of confidential subjects, such as drunkenness and cheating. Nathan is a fine storyteller, and her descriptions of Student Development people's efforts to 'create community' in the university are both funny and sad. My Freshman Year is funny, sad, true, eye-opening, and sometimes mind-boggling. If I knew the author, I would congratulate her with great warmth and enthusiasm."&#x2014;Emily Toth, Louisiana State University, author, "Ms. Mentor" column and ten books including Ms. Mentor's Impeccable Advice for Women in Academia, Unveiling Kate Chopin, and Inside Peyton Place: The Life of Grace Metalious </p><p>"The first thing to say about this book is that there are very few books like it. The author's account of living in the dorm and taking classes on a campus where she had worked as a professor for many years is fascinating. From her experience enrolled as a freshman and through her anthropological lens, we learn how different the world of students is from what professors imagine it to be. I think anyone with an interest in undergraduate life&#x2014;whether in academe or not&#x2014;will want to read it and will enjoy it."&#x2014;Margaret Eisenhart, University Distinguished Professor and Charles Chair of Education, University of Colorado at Boulder</p><b>Rebekah Nathan</b> is a pseudonym for Cathy Small. She is a professor of anthropology at Northern Arizona University and the author of <i>Voyages: From Tongan Villages to American Suburbs</i>.</p><h2>The Sun Also Rises</h2><p>Paris in the twenties: Pernod, parties and expatriate Americans, loose-living on money from home. Paris in the twenties: Pernod, parties and expatriate Americans, loose-living on money from home. Jake is wildly in love with Brett Ashley, aristocratic and irresistibly beautiful, with an abandoned, sensuous nature that she cannot change. When the couple drift to Spain to the dazzle of the fiesta and the heady atmosphere of the Bullfight, their affair is strained by new passions, new jealousies, and Jake must finally learn that he will never possess the woman that he loves.</p><p><i>The Sun Also Rises</i> first appeared in 1926, and yet it's as fresh and clean and fine as it ever was, maybe finer. Hemingway's famously plain declarative sentences linger in the mind like poetry: "Brett was damned good-looking. She wore a slipover jersey sweater and a tweed skirt, and her hair was brushed back like a boy's. She started all that." His cast of thirtysomething dissolute expatriates--Brett and her drunken fianc�, Mike Campbell, the unhappy Princeton Jewish boxer Robert Cohn, the sardonic novelist Bill Gorton--are as familiar as the "cool crowd" we all once knew. No wonder this quintessential lost-generation novel has inspired several generations of imitators, in style as well as lifestyle.<p> Jake Barnes, Hemingway's narrator with a mysterious war wound that has left him sexually incapable, is the heart and soul of the book. Brett, the beautiful, doomed English woman he adores, provides the glamour of natural chic and sexual unattainability. Alcohol and post-World War I anomie fuel the plot: weary of drinking and dancing in Paris caf�s, the expatriate gang decamps for the Spanish town of Pamplona for the "wonderful nightmare" of a week-long fiesta. Brett, with fianc� and ex-lover Cohn in tow, breaks hearts all around until she falls, briefly, for the handsome teenage bullfighter Pedro Romero. "My God! he's a lovely boy," she tells Jake. "And how I would love to see him get into those clothes. He must use a shoe-horn."

He is a Professor of Anthropology and Associate Provost at Boston University.Anthropology professor Wood examines two kinds of diversity. Diversity as physical and cultural variation among humans was propounded by nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century systematic anthropology. Diversity as the conviction that physical and cultural traits should determine one's eligibility for admission to college, career advancement, and bestowal of government largesse arose from Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell's freestanding decision in <i>Regents of the University of California </i>v.<i> Bakke</i>, in which he allowed that differences in race, gender, and other traits--designated as diversity--were worthy of consideration in distributing social goods. The new diversity quickly became an aggressive ideology, damaging American institutions and poisoning public discourse with "identity politics." Wood blames the Left for using diversity to undermine democracy and faintly praises the marketplace for trivializing it into a matter of lifestyle choice. But the marketplace is interested in making money off diversity, not quashing it. "We will be left," he sadly concludes his otherwise surprisingly congenial survey, "for a long while still, with the reign of <i>diversity</i>'s pasteboard stereotypes." <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Sass</b> is Professor of Clinical Psychology at Rutgers University. He is the author of <i>The Paradoxes of Delusion: Wittgenstein, Schreber, and the Schizophrenic Mind</i>.Does the schizophrenic's chaotic inner world resemble modern art and literature? Sass, a clinical psychologist and Rutgers professor, argues that schizophrenia and modernism display striking affinities: fragmentation, defiance of authority, multiple viewpoints, self-referentiality and rejection of the external world in favor of an omnipotent self or, alternately, a total loss of self. While the parallels he draws often seem superficial, there is much to ponder in Sass's notion that schizophrenia's core traits are exaggerations of tendencies fostered by our culture. This dense, startling work examines schizophrenic inauthenticity in light of the thought of Nietzsche, that champion of self-invention and the mask. Sass analyzes Kafka's introversion, Baudelaire's esthetics of disdain, Alfred Jarry's robotlike persona and the loss of self suffered by Antonin Artaud, a diagnosed schizophrenic. Further, he likens schizophrenics' deviant language to the prose of Rimbaud, Sartre, Beckett and Barthes.

The reader is taken on a journey through time and science that results in an unlikely connecting of the dots with profound therapeutic implications.</p> <p>Transporting us on a rich narrative of humanity&#x2019;s struggle to understand the cellular events that conspire to form malignancy, <em>Tripping over the Truth</em> reads like a detective novel, full of twists and cover-ups, blind-alleys and striking moments of discovery by men and women with uncommon vision, grit, and fortitude. Ultimately, Christofferson arrives at a conclusion that challenges everything we thought we knew about the disease, suggesting the reason for the failed war against cancer stems from a flawed paradigm that categorizes cancer as an exclusively genetic disease.</p> <p>For anyone affected by this terrifying disease and the physicians who struggle to treat it, this book provides a fresh and hopeful perspective. It explores the new and exciting non-toxic therapies born from the emerging metabolic theory of cancer. These therapies may one day prove to be a turning point in the struggle against our ancient enemy. We are shown how the metabolic theory redraws the battle map, directing researchers to approach cancer treatment from a different angle, framing it more like a gentle rehabilitation rather than all-out combat. In a sharp departure from the current &#x201c;targeted&#x201d; revolution occurring in cancer pharmaceuticals, the metabolic therapies highlighted have one striking feature that sets them apart&#x2015;the potential to treat all types of cancer because they exploit the one weakness that is common to every cancer cell: dysfunctional metabolism.</p> <p>With a foreword by Dr. Dominic D'Agostino, PhD and contributions from Thomas Seyfried, PhD, author of <em>Cancer as a Metabolic Disease</em>; Miriam Kalamian, EdM, MS, CNS, author of <em>Keto for Cancer</em>; and Beth Zupec Kania, consultant nutritionist of The Charlie Foundation.</p></p><p><p>Travis Christofferson, MS, is the author of <em>Curable</em> and&nbsp; <em>Tripping Over the Truth</em> and received his undergraduate degree in molecular biology from the Honors College at Montana State University and a master&#x2019;s degree in material engineering and science from the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology.

In <i>The Maltese Falcon</i>, Sam Spade, a private eye with his own solitary code of ethics, tangles with a beautiful and treacherous woman whose loyalties shift at the drop of a dime. <i>The Thin Man</i> introduces Hammett's wittiest creations, Nick and Nora Charles, who solve homicides in between wisecracks and martinis. And in <i>Red Harvest</i>, Hammett's anonymous tough-guy detective, the Continental Op, takes on the entire town of Poisonville in a deadly war against corruption.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Dashiell Hammett is a master of the detective novel, yes, but also one hell of a writer."&#x2014;<i>Boston Globe</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201d;Hammett was spare, hard-boiled, but he did over and over what only the best writers can ever do. He wrote scenes that seemed never to have been written before.&#x201d;&#x2014;Raymond Chandler</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201d;Hammett&#x2019;s prose was clean and entirely unique.

He grew up in Philadelphia and Baltimore. Hammett left school at the age of fourteen and held several kinds of jobs thereafter&#x2014;messenger boy, newsboy, clerk, operator, and stevedore, finally becoming an operative for Pinkerton&#x2019;s Detective Agency. Sleuthing suited young Hammett, but World War I intervened, interrupting his work and injuring his health. When Sergeant Hammett was discharged from the last of several hospitals, he resumed detective work. He soon turned to writing, and in the late 1920s Hammett became the unquestioned master of detective-story fiction in America. In&nbsp;<i>The Maltese Falcon&nbsp;</i>(1930) he first introduced his famous private eye, Sam Spade.&nbsp;<i>The Thin Man</i>&nbsp;(1932) offered another immortal sleuth, Nick Charles.&nbsp;<i>Red Harvest&nbsp;(</i>1929),&nbsp;<i>The Dain Curse</i>&nbsp;(1929), and&nbsp;<i>The Glass Key</i>&nbsp;(1931) are among his most successful novels. During World War II, Hammett again served as sergeant in the Army, this time for more than two years, most of which he spent in the Aleutians. Hammett&#x2019;s later life was marked in part by ill health, alcoholism, a period of imprisonment related to his alleged membership in the Communist Party, and by his long-time companion, the author Lillian Hellman, with whom he had a very volatile relationship. His attempt at autobiographical fiction survives in the story &#x201c;Tulip,&#x201d; which is contained in the posthumous collection&nbsp;<i>The Big Knockover</i>&nbsp;(1966, edited by Lillian Hellman). Another volume of his stories,&nbsp;<b>T</b><i>he Continental Op</i>&nbsp;(1974, edited by Stephen Marcus), introduced the final Hammett character: the &#x201c;Op,&#x201d; a nameless detective (or &#x201c;operative&#x201d;) who displays little of his personality, making him a classic tough guy in the hard-boiled mold&#x2014;a bit like Hammett himself.</p><h2>Williams&#39; Essentials of Nutrition and Diet Therapy</h2><p><p>From basic nutrition principles to the latest nutrition therapies for common diseases, <b>Williams' Essentials of Nutrition &amp; Diet Therapy, 11th Edition</b> offers a solid foundation in the fundamental knowledge and skills you need to provide effective patient care.

It tells how his unbridled political ambitions and his pledge to create jobs for Arkansas led him to compromise his ideals in exchange for support for his presidential candidacy in 1992. By selling out politically to the Reagan&#x2013;Bush administration, by giving the Agency free rein to operate a secret training base near the tiny western Arkansas of Mena, and by looking the other way as Arkansas factories turned out untraceable weapons parts for the Nicaraguan Contra &#x201c;freedom fighters,&#x201d; the young governor helped create an operation that laundered untold millions of dollars and that enriched Clinton&#x2019;s political friends and helped finance his campaign fund. The Arkansas-CIA connection became Clinton&#x2019;s darkest secret, and only now is the tiniest shaft of light being shed on what has become known as the Whitewater Scandal. Coauthor Terry Reed, who helped train Contra pilots in rural Arkansas, became the first person to pull back the shroud on the &#x201c;Arkansas Connection&#x201d; long before most people ever heard of Clinton cronies like Webb Hubbell, Clinton&#x2019;s former associate U.S. attorney-general, who became the first major figure to plead guilty in an ever-widening investigation that is confirming Reed&#x2019;s disclosures. Former National Security Advisor Bud McFarlane also corroborates Reed&#x2019;s revelation that former spymaster George Bush was in the center of the Iran-Contra loop, and he, like Reed, paints Bush as a cold-hearted powermonger bent on wrestling the White House away from Ronald Reagan. Reed, who was recruited into the Arkansas operation by Oliver North, reveals in this eyewitness account how the &#x201c;black operations&#x201d; in Arkansas worked, from the training of Contra pilots and the manufacture of weapons parts&#x2014;all in violation of a congressional ban on Contra aid&#x2014;to the airdrops of cash into Arkansas by CIA operative Barry Seal. Seal disclosed to Reed that more than $9 million a week was dropped from planes onto secret drop zones and later laundered through an investment banking firm whose president had close ties with Clinton.</p><p>Terry Reed is a former Air Force intelligence operative who served in the most secret project of the Vietnam War, Task Force Alpha. In civilian life, he was recruited by the FBI&#x2019;s counterintelligence division to help combat the illegal sale of technology to the Soviet Union and later became a CIA asset.

In doing so, Peak Performance uncovers new linkages that hold promise as performance enhancers but have been overlooked in our traditionally-siloed ways of thinking. The result is a life-changing book in which readers learn how to enhance their performance via myriad ways including: optimally alternating between periods of intense work and rest; priming the body and mind for enhanced productivity; and developing and harnessing the power of a self-transcending purpose.&nbsp;In revealing the science of great performance and the stories of great performers across a wide range of capabilities, Peak Performance uncovers the secrets of success, and coaches readers on how to use them.

If you try lifting weights that are too heavy, you probably won't make it past one repetition. And even if you do, you're liable to hurt yourself along the way. Lift too light a weight, on the other hand, and you won't see much, if any, result; your biceps simply won't grow. You've got to find the Goldilocks weight: an amount you can barely manage, that will leave you exhausted and fatigued-but not injured- by the time you've finished your workout. Yet discovering such an ideal weight is only half the battle. If you lift every day, multiple times a day, without much rest in between, you're almost certainly going to burn out. But if you hardly ever make it to the gym and fail to regularly push your limits, you're not going to get much stronger, either. The key to strengthening your biceps-and, as we'll learn, any muscle, be it physical, cognitive, or emotional-is balancing the right amount of stress with the right amount of rest. Stress + rest = growth. This equation holds true regardless of what it is that you are trying to grow.<br><br><b>PERIODIZATION</b><br><br>In the world of exercise science, this cycle of stress and rest is often referred to as periodization. Stress-and by this we don't mean fighting with your partner or your boss, but rather, some sort of stimulus, such as lifting a heavy weight-challenges the body, in some cases pushing it close to failure. This process is usually followed by a slight dip in function; just think about how useless your arms are after a hard weight-lifting session. But if after the stressful period you give your body time to rest and recover, it adapts and becomes stronger, allowing you to push a little harder in the future. Over time, the cycle looks like this: 1.Isolate the muscle or capability you want to grow 2.Stress it 3.Rest and recover, allowing for adaptation to occur 4.Repeat-this time stressing the muscle or capability a bit more than you did the last time World-class athletes are masters at this cycle. On a micro level, their training alternates between hard days (e.g., intervals until the brink of muscle failure and total exhaustion) and easy days (e.g., jogging at a pedestrian pace). The best athletes also prioritize recovery, time on the couch and in bed, just as much as they prioritize time on the track or in the gym. On a more macro level, great athletes often follow a hard month of training with an easy week. They intentionally design their seasons to include only a few peak events that are followed by periods of physical and psychological restoration. The days, weeks, months, years, and entire careers of master athletes represent a continual ebb and flow between stress and rest. Those who can't figure out the right balance either get hurt or burn out (too much stress, not enough rest) or become complacent and plateau (not enough stress, too much rest). Those who can figure out the right balance, however, become life-long champions.<br><br><b>SUSTAINABLE PERFORMANCE</b><br><br>When Deena Kastor graduated from the University of Arkansas in 1996, she was a good collegiate runner who had never quite pulled off a major victory. She received multiple All-American awards and stood atop many podiums, but the collegiate national championship was always just a touch-a few seconds, to be precise-out of reach. This didn't deter Kastor from going all-in on running. Upon graduation, she connected with the legendary coach Joe Vigil and followed him to the oxygen-deprived air of Alamosa, Colorado, and ultimately to Mammoth Lakes, California. There, training at 9,000 feet above sea level, Kastor went to work on reaching a level far beyond what her collegiate success could have predicted. Glimpse into Kastor's training diary during her prime and one word comes to mind: extraordinary. A 24-mile-long run at 7,000 feet altitude; mile repeats at speeds that for most people would be equivalent to an all-out 100-yard dash; and her favorite, 4 by 2 miles at a lung-searing 5-minute- mile pace, all on the highest path in Mammoth Lakes. These heroic workouts make up only a small portion of Kastor's total running. At the end of each week, in the bottom right corner of her training journal, she circled "total miles run." This number almost always read between 110 and 140. While this may seem extraordinary, to Kastor it was all very ordinary. As a result, she reached the highest levels of athletic success. Deena Kastor is hands-down the name most associated with American women's running, and for good reason. She's won an Olympic bronze medal in the marathon, and has earned distinction in many major national races. She holds the American marathon record, having covered the 26.2 miles in just 2 hours and 19 minutes, or at a pace of 5 minutes and 20 seconds per mile. Just think about running one mile that fast, and then imagine doing it 26 times in a row. Perhaps even harder to comprehend is the 2 hour and 27 minute marathon (5 minute and 40 second mile pace) she ran at age 42. That's right, Kastor is still running insanely fast well into what should be the twilight of her endurance sports career. And although she may lose an occasional race to someone 10 to 20 years her junior, she's consistently at the front of the pack, racing against, and often beating, women young enough to be her daughters. Ask Kastor how she's been able to sustain this level of performance and you'll get a lesson in periodization. While Kastor's quick to mention the hard work she puts in, she's equally as quick to mention the rest that follows. "The leaps and bounds I've made over the last several years have come from outside the training environment and how I choose to recover," she told Competitor magazine in 2009. "During a workout you're breaking down soft tissue and really stressing your body. How you treat yourself in between workouts is where you make gains and acquire the strength to attack the next one." Kastor says she realized early on that simply working hard wouldn't do. She's even called her workouts the easy part. What sets her apart, the magic that has allowed her to run so fast and so far for the past 25 years, is how she recovers: the 10 to 12 hours of sleep she gets each night; her meticulous approach to diet; her weekly massage and stretching sessions. In other words, it's all the things she does when she isn't training that allows her to do what she does when she is. Stress demands rest, and rest supports stress. Kastor has mastered the inputs, and understands how much stress she can tolerate and how much rest she requires. Thus, the output-a lifetime of growth and excellence-isn't all that surprising.<br><br><b>ALL THE BEST FOLLOW STRESS AND REST</b><br><br>Kastor is certainly unique, but her story is echoed by the research of Stephen Seiler. In 1996, shortly after earning his PhD in physiology in the United States, Seiler relocated to Norway. When he first arrived, he noticed something that befuddled him: During cross-training runs, world- class cross-country skiers were stopping before hills and then slowly walking up. Seiler didn't understand. Why were some of the best endurance athletes on the planet training so easily? Seiler tracked down Norway's national cross-country ski coach, Inge Bråten, the man behind the training of legends such as eight-time Gold medalist Bjørn Dæhlie. He asked Bråten if he was imagining athletes slowly walking up hills in their training, and if not, could Bråten please explain what was going on. Bråten simply told Seiler that the skiers he saw walking had recently trained hard, so now they must train easy. Upon hearing this, Seiler's mind flashed back to a paper he'd read that claimed Kenyan runners spent a majority of their training time running at a snail's pace. When he revisited the research, Seiler also saw it mentioned that the Kenyans alternated between very hard days and very easy days. At that moment, it struck Seiler that the best summer athletes in the world and the best winter athletes in the world appeared to be training quite similarly. As any good scientist would, he set out to test his hypothesis. Seiler tracked the training of elite athletes across a variety of endurance sports including running, skiing, swimming, and cycling. He found that, irrespective of sport or nationality, their training followed roughly the same distribution. The best athletes in the world weren't adhering to a "no pain, no gain" model, nor were they doing fitness-magazine popularized high- intensity interval training (HIIT) or random "workouts of the day." Rather, they were systematically alternating between bouts of very intense work and periods of easy training and recovery, even if that meant walking up hills. The ongoing progression and development of elite competitors, Seiler found, was an exercise in stress and rest.<br><br><b>INTELLECTUAL AND CREATIVE DEVELOPMENT</b><br><br>Around the same time that Seiler was exploring commonalities among the top endurance athletes in the world, another researcher was exploring commonalities among the top creative and intellectual performers in the world. This researcher was Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (pronounced chick-sent- mi-hi), PhD, a pioneer in the field of positive psychology known for his ideas on happiness, meaning, and optimal performance. If you've ever heard of the term "flow"-or a state of being fully absorbed in an activity with laserlike focus, completely in the zone-that's Csikszentmihalyi's work. Less known than his work on flow, but equally insightful, is Csikszentmihalyi's study of creativity. Over the course of 50 years, he conducted hundreds of interviews with field-altering geniuses from diverse domains. He spoke with groundbreaking inventors, innovative artists, Nobel Prize-winning scientists, and Pulitzer Prize-winning writers. Just as Seiler found that world-class endurance athletes migrate toward a similar style of work, Csikszentmihalyi found that the same held true for creative geniuses: the brightest minds spend their time either pursuing an activity with ferocious intensity, or engaging in complete restoration and recovery. This approach, Csikszentmihalyi discovered, not only prevents creative burnout and cognitive fatigue, but it also fosters breakthrough ideas and discoveries (we'll explore why this happens in more detail in Chapter 4). Csikszentmihalyi documented a common process across almost all great intellectual and creative performers, regardless of their field: 1.Immersion: total engagement in their work with deep, unremitting focus 2.Incubation: a period of rest and recovery when they are not at all thinking about their work 3.Insight: the occurrence of "aha" or "eureka" moments-the emergence of new ideas and growth in their thinking<br><br><b>PERFORMANCE</b> <b>PRACTICES</b><br><br>.Alternate between cycles of stress and rest in your most important pursuits. .Insert short breaks throughout your work over the course of a day. .Strategically time your "off-days," long weekends, and vacations to follow periods of heavy stress. .Determine when your work regularly starts to suffer. When you find that point, insert a recovery break just prior to it. Look familiar? The manner in which great intellectual and creative performers continually grow their minds mirrors the manner in which great physical performers continually grow their bodies. Perhaps this is because our muscles and minds are more alike than we might think. Just as our muscles deplete and run out of energy, as we're about to see, our minds do, too.<br><br><b>MIND AS A MUSCLE</b><br><br>In the mid-1990s, Roy Baumeister, PhD, a social psychologist who at the time was teaching at Case Western Reserve University, revolutionized how we think about the mind and its capacity. Baumeister wanted to get to the bottom of common-day struggles such as why we feel mentally "tired" after toiling away at a complex problem. Or when we are on a diet, why we are more likely to crack at night after diligently resisting unhealthy food all day. In other words, Baumeister was interested in understanding how and why our intellectual power and our willpower run out of gas. When Baumeister set out to solve this problem, he didn't need the latest and greatest brain-imaging technology. All he needed were some cookies and radishes. In an elegantly designed experiment, Baumeister and his colleagues had 67 adults file into a room that smelled like chocolate chip cookies. After the participants had taken their seats, freshly baked cookies were brought into the room. No sooner than everyone's salivary glands began working, things got interesting. While half the study participants were allowed to eat the cookies, the other half were prohibited from doing so. Adding insult to injury, the non-cookie-eaters were given radishes and told they could eat them instead. As you might imagine, the cookie-eaters had no problem with the first part of the experiment. Like most people in their situation, they enjoyed indulging. The radish-eaters, on the other hand, struggled mightily. "The [radish-eaters] exhibited clear interest in the cookies, to the point of looking lovingly at the display and in a few cases even picking up the cookies to sniff them," writes Baumeister. Resisting the cookies was no easy task. This doesn't seem groundbreaking. Who wouldn't struggle to resist delicious desserts? But things got even more interesting in the second part of the experiment, during which the radish-eaters' struggles continued. After both groups finished eating, all participants were asked to solve a seemingly solvable, but actually unsolvable, problem. (Yes, this was a cruel experiment, especially for those stuck with the radishes.) The radish- eaters lasted a little over 8 minutes and gave the problem 19 attempts. The cookie-eaters, on the other hand, persisted for over 20 minutes and attempted to solve the problem 33 times. Why the stark difference? Because the radish-eaters had depleted their mental muscle by resisting the cookies, whereas the cookie-eaters had a full tank of psychological gas and thus exerted far more effort in trying to solve the problem. Baumeister went on to repeat several variations of this study, and he observed the same result every time. Participants who were forced to flex their mental muscle-be it to resist temptation, solve a hard puzzle, or make tough decisions-performed worse on a subsequent task that also required mental energy as compared to participants in a control group who had an easy first task, like eating fresh cookies.</p><h2>Intermediate Microeconomics with Calculus: A Modern Approach</h2><p><p><strong>Rigorous and modern&#x2015;now with calculus integrated into the main text.</strong></p> The #1 text is still the most modern presentation of the subject and gives students tools to develop the problem-solving skills they need for the course, and beyond.</p><p>Hal R.

Having used everything from Jenney to Ecce to Latin for Americans to Cambridge, I really appreciate using Latin for the New Millennium for a few reasons. First, it is clear in terms of terminology. Grammatical terms, sometimes troublesome for students new to Latin, are explained thoroughly and used copiously. Additionally, authentic Latin is referenced from the earliest stages of Latin. Students meet authors and have a good overview of the changes in Rome, in literature, politics, and society. Finally, I think it is the best preparation for the AP while still attending to conversation and oral Latin. Not only am I confident that I can finish the 1st year text in a year, but I am also confident that my students will have a better understanding of the Romans as well as their language and our own. Having the built-in support in the online resource center is also valuable and something that I would like to see us use and develop as we mature in the series. From a teaching standpoint, it is so helpful to have not only the resource center but also all of the ancillaries. With Latin for the New Millennium there is no need for teachers to re-invent the wheel each and every year. Support (Pedagogical, technological, and ancillary) is built into the series and into to system as a whole to allow teachers to use, borrow, and adapt what they need in terms of worksheets, explanations, vocabulary lists, and study guides.</p><p> My Latin I students feel that they have an advantage not only in the classroom but also in their extracurricular competitions because of this text and even reference points (especially about Cicero and Caesar so far) from the Latin text in their History and English classrooms.' --Sherry Jankowski, The Meadows School - Las Vegas, Nevada</p></p><h2>The Inquisitive Cook: Discover the Unexpected Science of the Kitchen (Accidental Scientist an Exploratorium Book)</h2><p><p>In a light, anecdotal, but highly informative style, seasoned cooking writers reveal the unexpected and always practical science of the kitchen.

Torricelli Editor of "Quotations for Public Speakers: A Historical, Literary and Political Anthology" <p>Q:How, why, and over what period of time did you collect these quotations? </p><p>A:I began collecting quotations during my time working for Vice President Walter Mondale. Vice President Mondale carried a notebook of scraps of paper with quotations that had been gathered by himself and by Hubert Humphrey before him. It was given to me and has stayed with me ever since. As my life in public service progressed I continued to gather quotes for use in public speaking engagements. In nearly twenty years in Congress I have had the opportunity to collect a very large portfolio of quotes from a broad range of sources. </p><p>Q:Why did you decide to compile them into a book? </p><p>A:As a Member of Congress, I am called on to speak publicly nearly every day in some fashion. I have found no book of quotations adequate for the purpose of public speaking because most books of quotations are written for use in term papers or publications. I felt it was time for a book that focused on public speaking and the collection that I had amassed provided a good beginning. </p><p>Q:Who do you see as the audience for your book? </p><p>A:Every professional is called upon to speak at some point in some way. Someone in business, a civic leader or someone in politics - all are required to speak at some point and all should have a resource that will allow them to add so much power to their words. A good quotation can crystallize a thought for an audience and can solidify a point for a speaker. Every professional will need to do that sometime during their career. </p><p>Q:There are many quotation collections. What makes yours unique? </p><p>A:This collection is the only one that I am aware of that is specifically gathered for use in public speaking. Most collections are written for use in printed materials and papers. Quotes for speeches must be powerful - the ear cannot return to spoken word, but the eye can read a quote again and again. A quote for a speech has to be that much more clear and compelling. In this collection, I tried to find quotes that met that standard and were relevant to the common topics of public speaking. </p><p>Q:Do you have a favorite speaker who is quoted in the book? Why do you find this speaker so appealing? </p><p>A:Robert Kennedy is my political hero and the man whose quotes I most admire. His ability to cite literature and verse with great ease is compelling and he possessed lyrical skills that have hardly been matched in history. </p><p>Q:Do you have a favorite quotation from the book, one that you find yourself using often? What is it about this quotation that you find so useful? </p><p>A:Robert Kennedy's "Freedom by itself is not enough...what counts is the use to which men put freedom," because it so succinctly gives a sense of our responsibilities as Americans. </p><p>Q:In the book, you divide the quotations into 50 different subject areas. Were there any subject areas you found particularly enjoyable to work on? </p><p>A:The Latin quotations were the most interesting for me and were the most enlightening. The use of Latin really grabs an audience's attention and the use of quotes from the Roman Empire increases credibility because they have so powerfully stood the test of time. </p><p>Q:Public speaking can be a very stressful experience. As a veteran public speaker, how can you seamlessly integrate a quotation into a speech without making it seem forced? </p><p>A:The most important point to remember in delivering a quotation during a speech is to be sure to understand, and be able to define, the context in which the words were first used. This shows familiarity, continuity and understanding. The right words in the right context can intensify an argument immeasurably and understanding their context can equally increase a speaker's comfort level.</p><p>Robert Guy Torricelli (born August 27, 1951), nicknamed "the Torch", is an American politician who served as the United States senator from New Jersey from 1997 to 2003 and a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from New Jersey's 9th district from 1983 to 1997.

That book detailed the dividend-value strategy behind <i>Investment Quality Trends</i>, the highly successful newsletter Weiss founded and Kelley Wright now edits. Today, more than twenty years later, the investment world has changed dramatically because of computer technology and the Internet. Tremendous amounts of data and information can be gathered, sorted, and analyzed in a matter of minutes, and what used to take weeks or months at a library can now be accomplished in one evening with a computer. What hasn't changed is the success of the dividend-value strategy for producing consistent gains in the stock market. <i>Dividends Still Don't Lie</i> shows how the stock market still rewards investors who recognize and appreciate good value. <p>Rather than emphasize price alone or a company's sector, products, or other analytical factors, the dividend-value strategy uses dividend-yield patterns to make buying and selling decisions. In simple terms: a stock is most attractive when it offers a high-dividend yield. As investors rush in to lock down the high yield, their buying pushes the price higher. Eventually the price reaches an area where the current yield is no longer attractive and buying stops. With no new buyers to push the stock price higher, the price begins to decline&#x2014;and early investors sell and take their profits. Wright shows that, by understanding the historical dividend-yield pattern of a company, you will be better informed as to whether the stock offers much value, little value, or value that's somewhere in-between.</p> <p>Four plus decades of research have shown that blue chip companies, those with long records of consistent, competent performance, are far more predictable than are upstarts or less established companies with erratic records of earnings and dividend payments. In short, the dividend-value strategy is a proven, commonsense approach that has ultimately led to long-term results. <i>Dividends Still Don't Lie</i> will show you how to master the stock market by successfully investing in high- quality, dividend-paying blue chip stocks.</p><b>"After all these years, I am pleased to note that dividends <i>still</i> don't lie."&#x2014;from the Foreword by Geraldine Weiss, co-author of <i>Dividends Don't Lie</i></b> <p><b>Praise for DIVIDENDS STILL DON'T LIE</b></p> <p>"In the coming years, there will be increased focus on income and dividends as Boomers look to turn their savings into retirement income.

Thankfully, in addition to a magnificent literary legacy&#x2014;which includes seven novels and three co-authored works of nonfiction&#x2014;Douglas left us something more. The book you are about to enjoy was rescued from his four computers, culled from an archive of chapters from his long-awaited novel-in-progress, as well as his short stories, speeches, articles, interviews, and letters. <br><br>In a way that none of his previous books could, <i>The Salmon of Doubt</i> provides the full, dazzling, laugh-out-loud experience of a journey through the galaxy as perceived by Douglas Adams. From a boy&#x2019;s first love letter (to his favorite science fiction magazine) to the distinction of possessing a nose of heroic proportions; from climbing Kilimanjaro in a rhino costume to explaining why Americans can&#x2019;t make a decent cup of tea; from lyrical tributes to the sublime pleasures found in music by Procol Harum, the Beatles, and Bach to the follies of his hopeless infatuation with technology; from fantastic, fictional forays into the private life of Genghis Khan to extended visits with Dirk Gently and Zaphod Beeblebrox: this is the vista from the elevated perch of one of the tallest, funniest, most brilliant, and most penetrating social critics and thinkers of our time.<br><br>Welcome to the wonderful mind of Douglas Adams.</p><p>Adams authored five novels in the Guide, two Dirk Gently novels, and several other books.&#x201c;Above all, of course, Douglas Adams was a transcendent, multi-faceted, comic genius. What made Douglas&#x2019;s work unique, I think, were the wildly contradictory attributes he displayed in his writing. He seamlessly blended world-class intelligence&#x2014;and a daunting knowledge about an impossible variety of subjects (literature, computers, evolution, pop culture, genetics, and music, to name but a few)&#x2014;with transcendental silliness; technophobia with a lust for, and fascination with, every high-tech toy imaginable; deep cynicism about virtually everything with an effusively joyful spirit; and one of the quickest wits on the planet with a relentless perfectionism in pursuing his craft.&#x201d; &#x2014;From the Introduction by Christopher Cerf<br><br>&#x201c;The bottom drawer of recently deceased writers is often best left firmly locked and bolted. In the case of Douglas, I am sure you will agree, the bottom drawer (or in his case, the nested subfolders of his hard drive) has been triumphantly well worth the prising open. There are those who write from time to time and do it well, and then there are Writers. Douglas Adams, and it is pointless to attempt here an explanation or anatomisation, was born, grew up, and remained a Writer to his too-early dying day. <br>&#x201c;You are on the verge of entering the wise, provoking, benevolent, hilarious, and addictive world of Douglas Adams. Don&#x2019;t bolt it all whole&#x2014;as with Douglas&#x2019;s beloved Japanese food, what seems light and easy to assimilate is subtler and more nutritious by far than it might at first appear.&#x201d; &#x2014;Stephen Fry, author of <i>The Liar</i> and <i>Making History: A Novel</i></p><h2>The Traveler&#39;s Key to Ancient Egypt: A Guide to Sacred Places</h2><p>To appreciate the extraordinary treasures of ancient Egypt, a traveler needs an extraordinary guidebook.

Strikingly autobiographical in its childhood scenes, it relates David's history from birth to young manhood, and the host of characters he meets on his journey of self-knowledge: Mr Micawber, the Peggottys, Betsey Trotwood, Steerforth and Uriah Heep among them.</p><p>Please note that this is an MP3-CD. This is also available on cassette.<p> In a preface to this novel, Dickens described David Copperfield as his &#x201c;favorite child,&#x201d; and the story has remained among the favorites of Dickens&#x2019; readers, too, with the characters of Betsy Trotwood, Mr. Pegotty, Uriah Heep, and Wilkins Micawber as well as David himself becoming part of the fabric of Western culture. This facsimile reprint is of the <em>Household Edition of the Works of Charles Dickens</em>, published in the 1870s; the edition makes the work available again in a form in which tens of thousands of Victorians read it&#x2015;in two-column format, interspersed with illustrations throughout. </p> <p> <em>David Copperfield</em> was originally published in nineteen monthly parts between May 1, 1849 and November 1, 1850.* Each part except the last was of roughly the same length; the final installment was approximately twice as long as the others (and sold for 2 shillings, twice the price of previous parts). For the original serial publication, as well as early publication in book form, <em>David Copperfield</em> was illustrated by Hablot Browne (more commonly known as &#x201c;Phiz&#x201d;). </p> <p> Shortly after Dickens&#x2019; death in 1870 the British publisher Chapman &amp; Hall began to issue the <em>Household Edition of the Works of Charles Dickens</em> (not to be confused with the American <em>Household Edition of the Works</em>, which appeared in the 1860s). The principal illustrator for the edition was Fred Barnard, and the Dalziel brothers (the leading wood-engravers of the time) created the engravings from Barnard&#x2019;s illustrations; they described <em>The Household Edition</em> as &#x201c;by far the most important commission ever placed in our hands by Messrs. Chapman &amp; Hall.&#x201d; Volumes in <em>The Household Edition</em> began to appear in 1871, and the series was completed in 1879. Dickens&#x2019; works appeared in a great many Victorian editions (including numerous pirated ones). Scholars have understandably paid most attention to the earliest publication in serial form; <em>The Household Edition</em> may well have been the most popular form in which the novel appeared, however; the plates for <em>The Household Edition</em> were widely used for other editions as well, and it is certainly arguable that more Victorian readers would have read Dickens&#x2019; novels in this form than in any other. In 1911 the populist bibliophile J.A. Hammerton described <em>The Household Edition</em> as &#x201c;the most important illustrated edition&#x201d; of Dickens&#x2019; works. </p> <p> This is one of a series from Broadview Press of facsimile editions&#x2015;editions that provide readers with a direct sense of these works as the Victorians themselves experienced them. </p> <p> The breaks were as follows: I &#x2013; May 1849 (chs. 1&#x2013;3); II &#x2013; June 1849 (chs. 4&#x2013;6); III &#x2013; July 1849 (chs. 7&#x2013;9); IV &#x2013; August 1849 (chs. 10&#x2013;12); V &#x2013; September 1849 (chs. 13&#x2013;15); VI &#x2013; October 1849 (chs. 16&#x2013;18); VII &#x2013; November 1849 (chs. 19&#x2013;21); VIII &#x2013; December 1849 (chs. 22&#x2013;24); IX &#x2013; January 1850 (chs. 25&#x2013;27); X &#x2013; February 1850 (chs. 28&#x2013;31); XI &#x2013; March 1850 (chs. 32&#x2013;34); XII &#x2013; April 1850 (chs. 35&#x2013;37); XIII &#x2013; May 1850 (chs. 38&#x2013;40); XIV &#x2013; June 1850 (chs. 41&#x2013;43); XV &#x2013; July 1850 (chs. 44&#x2013;46); XVI &#x2013; August 1850 (chs. 47&#x2013;50); XVII &#x2013; September 1850 (chs. 51&#x2013;53); XVIII &#x2013; October 1850 (chs. 54&#x2013;57); XIX-XX &#x2013; November 1850 (chs. 58&#x2013;64). </p></p><h2>The Magic of Believing: The Science of Setting Your Goal and Then Reaching It</h2><p><b>MILLIONS OF READERS HAVE PROVED THAT THE MAGIC OF BELIEVING WORKS WONDERS!</b> <br> For more than four decades success-oriented Americans have turned to the no-nonsense, time-tested motivational techniques described in <i>The Magic of Believing</i> to achieve all their long- and short-term goals: a better job, an increased income, a happier marriage, or simply a good night's sleep.

Bristo<b>l</b>&nbsp;was a lawyer, lecturer, investment banker, and foreign correspondent. He is the coauthor of the long-time bestseller,&nbsp;<i>TNT: The Power Within.</i><b>Chapter One</b><br><br><b>How I came to tap the power of belief</b><br><br>Is there some force, or factor, or power, or science -- call it what you will -- which a few people understand and use to overcome their difficulties and achieve outstanding success? I firmly believe that there is, and it is my purpose in this book to try to explain it so that you can use it if you desire.<br><br>Around 1933 the financial editor of a great Los Angeles newspaper attended lectures I gave to financial men in that dry and read my brochure <i>T.N.T. -- It Rocks the Earth.</i> Afterwards, he wrote,<br><br>"You have caught from the ether something that has a mystical quality -- a something that explains the magic of coincidence, the mystery of what makes men lucky."<br><br>I realized that I had run across something that was practical and workable. But I didn't consider it then (neither do I now) as anything mystical, except in the sense that it is unknown to the majority of people. This "something" has always been known to a fortunate few down the centuries, but for some unknown reason it is still barely understood by the average person.<br><br>Years ago, when I started to teach this science by means of ? lectures and my brochure, I wasn't certain that the concepts could be grasped by the ordinary individual. But since then, I have seen those who have used it to double and triple their incomes, build their own successful businesses, acquire homes of their dreams, and create sizable fortunes. I am now convinced that any intelligent person who is sincere with himself can reach any heights he desires. I had no intention of writing a second book, although many urged me to do so. But a few months ago, a woman in the book business who had sold many copies of my first little book literally read me the riot act:<br><br>"You have a duty to give to the men and women who seek places for themselves in the world, in easily understood form, the new material that you have given in your lectures. Everyone of ambition wants to get ahead, and you have amply demonstrated that you have something that will help anyone. It's up to you to pass it along."<br><br>It took time to sell myself on the idea. But having served as a soldier in World War I, mostly in France and Germany, and having been active for many years in ex-service men's organizations as well as a state commission for the rehabilitation of ex-service men and women, I realized that it would be hard for many individuals to make outstanding places for themselves in a world from which they had long been separated. It is with a sincere desire to help them, as well as all ambitious men and women, that I write this more full and detailed exposition of the Power of Belief. Thus this work is written also to help develop individual thinking and doing.<br><br>Since this book may fall into the hands of some who may call me a crackpot or screwball, let me say that I am past the half-century mark and have had many years of hard practical business experience -- as well as a goodly number of years as a newspaper man. I started as a police reporter. Police reporters are trained to get facts and take nothing for granted. For a two-year period I was church editor of a large metropolitan newspaper, during which I came in close contact with clergymen and leaders of all sects and denominations, mind-healers, divine healers, Spiritualists, Christian Scientists, New Thought-ers, Unity leaders, sun and idol worshipers -- and, yes, even a few infidels and pagans.<br><br>The well-known English evangelist Gypsy Smith was making a tour of America at that time. Night after night as I sat on his platform, watching people stumble down the aisles, some sobbing, others shouting hysterically, I wondered....<br><br>Again I wondered when I accompanied the police in answering a riot call: some Holy Rollers in a moment of hysteria had knocked over a stove and set fire to their meeting hall. When I attended my first (and only) meeting of Shakers, I wondered -- as I did while attending various spiritualistic meetings. I wondered as I heard the testimonials at the Christian Scientists' Wednesday night meetings. I wondered when I watched a group of people immersed in the icy waters of a mountain stream and coming up shouting "Hallelujah!" even though their teeth were chattering. I wondered at the Indians' ceremonial dances and their rain-dance rituals. Billy Sunday also caused me to wonder as, in later years, did Aimee Semple McPherson.<br><br>In France during the First World War, I marveled at the simple faith of the peasants and the powers of their village <i>cur�es.</i> I heard stories of miracles at Lourdes, and of somewhat similar miracles at other shrines. When in a famous old Roman church, I saw elderly men and women climb literally on their knees up a long flight of stairs to gaze upon a holy urn -- a climb that is no simple task for an athletically trained young person -- I wondered again.<br><br>Business brought me into contact with the Mormons, and when I heard the story of Joseph Smith and the revelations on the plates of gold, I was again given to wonder. The Dukhobors of western Canada, who would doff their clothes when provoked, likewise made me wonder. While in Hawaii I heard much about the powers of the kahunas who could, it was claimed, cause people to die or live by praying. The great powers attributed to these kahunas profoundly impressed me.<br><br>In my early days as a newspaper man, I saw a famous medium try to make "spirits" respond before a crowded courtroom of antagonistic scoffers. The judge had promised to release the medium if he could get the "spirits" to speak in the courtroom. Yet they failed to materialize, and I wondered why -- because the medium's followers had testified to remarkable s�ances.<br><br>Many years later, I was commissioned to write a series of articles on what the police call the "fortune-telling racket." I visited everyone from gypsy phrenologists to crystal-ball gazers, from astrologers to spiritualistic mediums. I heard what purported to be the voices of old Indian "guides" tell me the past, the present, and the future, and I heard from relatives I never knew existed.<br><br>Several times I have been in a hospital room in which people around me died, while others with seemingly worse ailments were up and -- apparently -- fully recovered within a short time. I have known of partially paralyzed people who got over their condition in a matter of days. I have known people who claim to have cured their rheumatism or arthritis by wearing a copper band around their wrists -- others by mental healing. From relatives and close friends I have heard stories of how warts on hands suddenly disappeared. I am familiar with the stories of those who permit rattlesnakes to bite them and still live; and with hundreds of other tales of mysterious happenings and healings.<br><br>Moreover, I have made myself familiar with the lives of great men and women of history and have met and interviewed many outstanding men and women in all lines of human endeavor. Often I have wondered just what it was that took them to the top. I have seen coaches take seemingly inferior baseball and football teams and infuse them with something that caused them to win. In the Depression days, I saw badly whipped sales organizations do an abrupt about-face and bring in more business than ever before.<br><br>Apparently I was born with a huge bump of curiosity, for 1 have always had an insatiable yearning to seek answers and explanations. This quest has taken me to many strange places, brought to light many peculiar cases, and caused me to read every book I could get my hands on dealing with religions, cults, and physical and mental sciences. I have read literally thousands of books on modem psychology, metaphysics, ancient magic, Voodoo, Yoga, Theosophy, Christian Science, Unity, Truth, New Thought, Cou�ism, and many others dealing with what I call "Mind Stuff," as well as the philosophies and teachings of great masters of the past.<br><br>Many were nonsensical, others strange, and many very profound. Gradually I discovered that a golden thread runs through all the teachings and makes them work for those who sincerely accept and apply them, and that thread can be named in the single word <i>belief.</i> It is this same element or factor -- belief -- that causes people to be cured through mental healing, enables others to climb high the ladder of success, and gets phenomenal results for all who accept it. <i>Why</i> belief works miracles is something that cannot be satisfactorily explained; but have no doubt that there's genuine magic in believing. "The magic of believing" became a phrase around which my thoughts steadily revolved.<br><br>I am convinced that the so-called secret fraternal organizations guard a real "royal secret" which very few members ever grasp. The conclusion must be that "no mind ever receives the truth until it is prepared to receive it." One order provides candidates with a very profound book (to be studied in connection with the degree work), which itself would be practically an open-sesame to life if the candidates could understand and follow its tenets. But few read it, complaining that "it is too deep" for them. I am convinced, too, that some of these organizations, like many secret orders which possess a knowledge and understanding of life, use parables and misinterpretations to mislead.<br><br>When <i>T.N.T. -- It Rocks the Earth</i> was first published, I imagined that it would be easily understood since I had written it simply. But as the years went by, some readers protested that it was too much in digest form. Others said they couldn't understand it. I had assumed that most people knew something about the power of thought. Now I realize that I was mistaken, and those who had an understanding of the subject were comparatively few. Later, over many years of lecturing before clubs, business and sales organizations, I discovered that most people were vitally interested in the subject, but that it had to be fully explained. Finally, I undertook to write this book in words that anyone can understand -- and with the hope that it will help many to reach their goals in life.<br><br>The science of thought it as old as man himself. The wise men of all ages have known it and used it. The only thing I have done is to put the subject in modern language and bring to the reader's attention what some of today's outstanding minds are doing to substantiate the great truths that have come down through the centuries.<br><br>Fortunately for the world, people are coming to the realization that there is something to this "mind-stuff" after all. I believe that millions of people would like to get a better understanding of it -- and prove that it <i>does</i> work.<br><br>Therefore, let me start by relating a few experiences from my own life, with the hope that they will give you a better understanding of the entire science.<br><br>Early in 1918, I landed in France as a "casual" soldier, unattached to a regular company. As a result, it was several weeks before my service record (necessary for my pay) caught up with me. During that period I had no money to buy gum, candy, cigarettes, and the like, since the few dollars I had before sailing had been spent at the transport ship's canteen to relieve the monotony of the regular menu. Every time I saw a man light a cigarette or chew a stick of gum, it reminded me that I was without money to spend on myself. Certainly, I was eating, and the army clothed me and provided me with a place on the ground to sleep, but I grew bitter at having no spending money and no way of getting any. One night en-route to the forward area on a crowded troop train when sleep was out of the question, I made up my mind that on my return to civilian life, I would have a <i>lot</i> of money. The whole pattern of my life was altered at that moment.<br><br>True, I had been something of a reader in my youth; the Bible had been a must in our family. As a boy I was interested in wireless telegraphy, X-rays, high-frequency apparatus, and similar manifestations of electricity, and I had read every book on these subjects I could find. But while I was familiar with such terms as radiation frequencies, vibrations, oscillations, magnetic influences, etc., in those days they meant nothing to me outside of the strictly electrical field. Perhaps my first inkling of a connection between the mind and electrical or vibratory influences came when upon my completing law school, an instructor gave me an old book, Thomson Jay Hudson's <i>Law of Psychic Phenomena.</i> I read it, but only superficially. Either I did not understand it, or my mind was not ready to receive its profound truths. On that fateful night in the spring of 1918, when I told myself that some day I would have a lot of money, I did not realize that I was laying the groundwork for a series of causes which would unleash forces that would bring accomplishment. As a matter of fact, the idea never entered my mind that I could develop a fortune with my thinking and believing.<br><br>My Army classification card listed me as a newspaper man. I had been attending an Army Training School to qualify for a commission, but the whole training-school program was discontinued just as we finished the course; thus most of us landed in France as enlisted men. However, I considered myself a qualified journalist and felt that there was a better place for me in the American Expeditionary Force. Yet like many others, I found myself pushing wheelbarrows and lugging heavy shells and other ammunition.<br><br>Then one night at an ammunition depot near Toul, things began to happen. I was ordered to appear before the Commanding Officer, who asked me whom I knew at First Army Headquarters. I didn't know a soul there and didn't even know where it was located, and I told him so. Then he showed me orders directing me to report there immediately. A car and driver were provided, and the next morning found me at First Army Headquarters in charge of a daily progress bulletin. I was answerable only to a colonel.<br><br>During the months that followed, I frequently thought about the commission to which I was entitled. Then the links began to form into a chain. One day, entirely out of a clear sky, came orders transferring me to the <i>Stars and Stripes,</i> the Army newspaper; I had long had an ambition to be on its staff, but had done nothing about it. The next day, as I was preparing to leave for Paris, I was called before the colonel who showed me a telegram signed by the Adjutant General's office at GHQ, asking if I was available for commission. The colonel asked whether I would rather have a commission than report to the Army newspaper. Foreseeing that the war would soon end and I would be happier among other newspaper men, I said I would prefer the transfer to the <i>Stars and Stripes.</i> I never learned who was responsible for the telegram, but obviously something was working in my behalf.<br><br>Following the armistice, my desire to get out of the Army became insistent. I wanted to begin building that fortune. But the <i>Stars and Stripes</i> did not suspend publication until the summer of 1919, and it was August before I got home. However, the forces I had unconsciously set in motion were already setting the stage for me.<br><br>About nine-thirty the next morning after my arrival home, I received a telephone call from the president of a club in which I had been active. He told me to call a prominent man in the investment banking business who had read about my return and had expressed a wish to see me before I resumed newspaper work. I called the man and, two days later, embarked upon a long career as an investment banker, which later led me to the vice-presidency of a well-known Pacific Coast firm.<br><br>While my salary was smart at the start, I realized that...</p><h2>John Jay: Founding Father</h2><p><p>John Jay was a central figure in the early history of the American Republic. A New York lawyer, born in 1745, Jay served his country with the greatest distinction and was one of the most influential of its Founding Fathers. In the first full-length biography in almost seventy years, Walter Stahr brings Jay vividly to life, setting his astonishing career against the background of the American Revolution. </p><p>Drawing on substantial new material, Walter Stahr has written a full and highly readable portrait of both the public and private man. It is the story not only of John Jay himself, the most prominent native-born New Yorker of the eighteenth century, but also of his engaging and intelligent wife, Sarah, who accompanied her husband on his wartime diplomatic missions. This lively and compelling biography presents Jay in the light he deserves: as a major Founding Father, a true national hero, and a leading architect of America's future.</p></p><p>The first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court as well as President of the Continental Congress, Secretary of Foreign Affairs, and one time Governor of New York, John Jay was a Founding Father of paramount importance to the early Republic and did much to influence the shape of America&#39;s future. Walter Stahr&#39;s lively and engaging narrative illuminates the great life of an American soldier, politician, diplomat and lawyer. Readers will follow Jay&#39;s story through key events in early American history, such as the Revolutionary War, the writing of the Constitution, the first presidencies of the country, and the creation of our most authoritative legal body, the US Supreme Court. Now, Stahr presents Jay in the light he deserves: a Founding Father, a true national hero, and an architect of America&#39;s future."Walter Stahr has not only given us a meticulous study of the life of John Jay, but one very much written in the spirit of the man. It is thorough, fair, and consistently intelligent and presented with the most scrupulous accuracy." --Ron Chernow, author of Alexander Hamilton <p>"John Jay was a brilliant and fascinating statesman who, along with his friend Benjamin Franklin, helped define the values of American diplomacy. Walter Stahr writes with great insight, and this wonderful book should help restore Jay's place in the pantheon of our great Founding Fathers." -- Walter Isaacson, author of Benjamin Franklin: An American Life </p><p>"John Jay, the Founding Father most ignored by historians, has long awaited a good biography. Here it is! Jay played salient roles in many crucial aspects of the founding of the nation. He served in the Continental Congress, held diplomatic posts, played a vital role in the ratification of the Constitution, sat on the Supreme Court, and was governor of New York during the intensely partisan 1790s. Now, at last, a fine biography of this exceptional man is available. Walter Stahr has written a sensitive, illuminating, and provocative life history of Jay that will be welcomed by all who are interested in the American Revolution and the establishment of the Republic." --John Ferling, author of A Leap in the Dark: The Struggle to Create the American Republic and Adams Verses Jefferson: The Election of 1800 </p><p>"The Federalists built the foundation of our modern American government, and no Federalist leader better exemplifies their vision for a soon-to-be vast and great nation than John Jay. Co-author of the Federalist Papers, President of the Continental Congress, Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Chief Justice, Governor: this towering figure of the legislative, executive, and judicial branches made an amazing and indelible imprint on a nation destined to become the world's sole superpower. Walter Stahr's engrossing biography captures as no other book the complex character and profound thought of this influential American Founder, in the process helping us understand how a 55-year-old Governor of New York could decide to retire permanently from public life -- by rejecting the President's nomination, and the Senate's vote of ratification, that would have made him once again Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court." -- U.S. Rep.

The authors have sought to combine a sound and accurate (but not abstract) exposition of the elementary theory of differential equations with considerable material on methods of solution, analysis, and approximation that have proved useful in a wide variety of applications. While the general structure of the book remains unchanged, some notable changes have been made to improve the clarity and readability of basic material about differential equations and their applications. In addition to expanded explanations, the 11th edition includes new problems, updated figures and examples to help motivate students. <br><br>The program is primarily intended for undergraduate students of mathematics, science, or engineering, who typically take a course on differential equations during their first or second year of study. The main prerequisite for engaging with the program is a working knowledge of calculus, gained from a normal two9; or three9; semester course sequence or its equivalent. Some familiarity with matrices will also be helpful in the chapters on systems of differential equations.</p><p><b>Dr. William E.

In a new translation by Susan Bernofsky, <em>The Walk</em> is an elegant consideration of walking and the philosophical musings it engenders.</strong></p> A pseudo-biographical &#x201c;stroll&#x201d; through town and countryside rife with philosophical musings, <em>The Walk</em> has been hailed as the masterpiece of Walser&#x2019;s short prose. Walking features heavily in his writing, but nowhere else is it as elegantly considered. Without walking, &#x201c;I would be dead,&#x201d; Walser explains, &#x201c;and my profession, which I love passionately, would be destroyed. Because it is on walks that the lore of nature and the lore of the country are revealed, charming and graceful, to the sense and eyes of the observant walker.&#x201d; <em>The Walk</em> was the first piece of Walser&#x2019;s work to appear in English, and the only one translated before his death. However, Walser heavily revised his most famous novella, altering nearly every sentence, rendering the baroque tone of his tale into something more spare. An introduction by translator Susan Bernofsky explains the history of <em>The Walk</em>, and the differences between its two versions.</p><p><p><strong>Robert Walser</strong> (1878&#x2013;1956) was born in Switzerland. He left school at fourteen and led a wandering and precarious existence working as a bank clerk, a butler in a castle, and an inventor's assistant while producing essays, stories, and novels. In 1933 he abandoned writing and entered a sanatorium&#x2015;where he remained for the rest of his life. "I am not here to write," Walser said, "but to be mad."</p><p><strong>Susan Bernofsky</strong> is the acclaimed translator of Hermann Hesse, Robert Walser, and Jenny Erpenbeck, and the recipient of many awards, including the Helen and Kurt Wolff Prize and the Hermann Hesse Translation Prize. She teaches literary translation at Columbia University and lives in New York.</p>&#x201c;Incredibly interesting and beautiful.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>John Ashbery</strong><br><br>&#x201c;One of the most profound products of modern literature.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Walter Benjamin</strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>The Walk</em> is a good place to start reading Walser, and offers a kind of bridge between the novels and the microscripts.... The walk is a search for freedom, is an act of freedom itself, and the writing feels free to launch into invective, or drape itself in courtesy, as it pleases. It is an attempt to approximate writing to life, to subject it to circumstance and chance encounter, but for all its overt artificiality the story is deeply affecting.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Times Literary Supplement</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Walser&#x2019;s project is mirrored and echoed by modernity&#x2019;s general obsession with interiority and exploring new forms of subjectivity. We should understand Walser&#x2019;s poetics of smallness as being as grandiose as anything that modernity has produced.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Quarterly Conversation</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The hope that shines forth in the moments of self-knowledge, transcendence, and grace Walser describes is anything but meager: on the contrary, it is exultation the writer feels when he perceives the sublime in the tiniest details of everyday life.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Brooklyn Rail</em></strong></p><h2>Sacrificing Families: Navigating Laws, Labor, and Love Across Borders</h2><p>Widening global inequalities make it difficult for parents in developing nations to provide for their children, and both mothers and fathers often find that migration in search of higher wages is their only hope. Their dreams are straightforward: with more money, they can improve their children's lives. But the reality of their experiences is often harsh, and structural barriers&#x2015;particularly those rooted in immigration policies and gender inequities&#x2015;prevent many from reaching their economic goals. <i>Sacrificing Families</i> offers a first-hand look at Salvadoran transnational families, how the parents fare in the United States, and the experiences of the children back home. It captures the tragedy of these families' daily living arrangements, but also delves deeper to expose the structural context that creates and sustains patterns of inequality in their well-being. What prevents these parents from migrating with their children? What are these families' experiences with long-term separation? And why do some ultimately fare better than others? As free trade agreements expand and nation-states open doors widely for products and profits while closing them tightly for refugees and migrants, these transnational families are not only becoming more common, but they are living through lengthier separations. Leisy Abrego gives voice to these immigrants and their families and documents the inequalities across their experiences.</p><p>Leisy Abrego is Assistant Professor of Chicana/o Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles."Abrego examines the causes and consequences of migration of parents from El Salvador to the U.S. She focuses on the structure of trauma of long-term family separation, different experiences based on gender, and the impact on the socioeconomic and emotional lives of children . . . Using in-depth interviews of parents in the U.S. and children in El Salvador, the author reveals the tragedies and triumphs of these families' living arrangements; patterns of inequalities; migrant parents' sacrifices, including monetary remittances to their children; the profound emotional suffering; and children's school performances and aspirations. Furthermore, this research demonstrates how U.S. immigration policy determines the life chances and well-being of children and how gender ideologies influence women's and men's opportunities and behavior. Abrego presents a detailed, careful analysis of the micro-social realities of family separation across nations. She outlines the policy implications of this research and emphasizes the need for comprehensive U.S. immigration reform as a human rights issue. An outstanding contribution to immigration, family, Chicana/o, and policy studies . . . Highly recommended." (D. A. Chekki)<br><br>"<i>Sacrificing Families</i> approaches the issue of transnational migration from El Salvador to the United States from a unique perspective. Instead of the public debate in the United States, it's the debate in El Salvador that frames Leisy Abrego's argument. And while the experiences of migrants play a role, her focus is more on the children left behind when parents leave to work in the United States . . . In a debate dominated by rhetoric and statistics, the voices of these children raise extremely important issues . . . [T]his is a book that will stay with me and that I intend to assign to both undergraduate and graduate students." (Aviva Chomsky)<br><br>"In this insightful and compassionate book, Leisy Abrego sheds light on the devastating and far-reaching effects of the contemporary immigration regime on immigrant families and their relatives back home. The voices of these immigrant families vividly combine with Abrego's sophisticated analysis to make us rethink what it means to live in transnational spaces today. A must read for anyone interested in families and immigration policy." (Cecilia Menj�var <i>Arizona State University</i>)<br><br>"Leisy Abrego provides an eloquent, empathic view of the agonizing choices made by transnational parents and the consequences for their children. The poignant quotes&#x2015;from parents and children alike&#x2015;along Abrego's thoughtful analysis make this an essential read." (Carola Su�rez-Orozco, University of California <i>Los Angeles</i>)<br><br>"Leisy Abrego renders in heart-wrenching detail what it means to live as a family separated by thousands of miles. <i>Sacrificing Families</i> is a must read on why families choose to become transnational, how they struggle to overcome distance and time, and the United States immigration policies that force this cultural and emotional divide." (Leo R. Chavez <i>University of California, Irvine, author of <i>The Latino Threat: Constructing Immigrants, Citizens, and the Nation</i></i>)<br><br>"<i>Sacrificing Families</i> is an important new book analyzing what can be described as the psychosocial interior of transnational Salvadoran families and how that familial social life is structured and traumatized by America's current immigration regime . . . The book is an important step in what is developing into a very promising scholarly career." (Robert C. Smith <i><i>American Journal of Sociology</i></i>)</p><h2>The German War: A Nation Under Arms, 1939-1945</h2><p><b>A groundbreaking history of what drove the Germans to fight -- and keep fighting -- for a lost cause in World War II</b><br>In <i>The German War</i>, acclaimed historian Nicholas Stargardt draws on an extraordinary range of firsthand testimony -- personal diaries, court records, and military correspondence -- to explore how the German people experienced the Second World War. <br>When war broke out in September 1939, it was deeply unpopular in Germany. Yet without the active participation and commitment of the German people, it could not have continued for almost six years. What, then, was the war the Germans thought they were fighting?

And when did Germans first realize they were fighting a genocidal war?<br>Told from the perspective of those who lived through it -- soldiers, schoolteachers, and housewives; Nazis, Christians, and Jews -- this masterful historical narrative sheds fresh and disturbing light on the beliefs and fears of a people who embarked on and fought to the end a brutal war of conquest and genocide.</p><p><b>Nicholas Stargardt</b> is one of Britain's foremost scholars of Nazi Germany.

She went the back way, through the orange groves. When she cut out onto Palmetto Lane, she saw her cousin Joe Travis Joy standing out in front of his mother&#x2019;s house.<br> Joe Travis was nineteen years old. He had red hair and a tiny little red beard and a red Camaro, and a job roofing houses in Tamaray Beach.<br> Beverly didn&#x2019;t like him all that much.<br> &#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; said Joe Travis when he saw Beverly.<br> &#x201c;I thought you moved to Tamaray,&#x201d; said Beverly.<br> &#x201c;I did.

They were on the highway.<br> Beverly didn&#x2019;t answer Joe Travis. Instead, she stared at the green-haired troll hanging from the rearview mirror. She thought how the troll looked almost exactly like Joe Travis except that its hair was the wrong color and it didn&#x2019;t have a beard. Also, it seemed friendlier.<br> Joe Travis said, &#x201c;Do you like ZZ Top?&#x201d;<br> Beverly shrugged.<br> &#x201c;You want a cigarette?&#x201d; said Joe Travis.<br> &#x201c;No,&#x201d; said Beverly.<br> &#x201c;Suit yourself.&#x201d; Joe Travis lit a cigarette, and Beverly rolled down the window.<br> &#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; said Joe Travis. &#x201c;I got the AC on.&#x201d;<br> Beverly leaned her face into the hot air coming through the open window. She said nothing.<br> They went the whole way to Tamaray Beach with one window down and the air-conditioning on full blast. Joe Travis smoked six cigarettes and ate one strip of beef jerky. In between the cigarettes and the beef jerky, he tapped his fingers on the steering wheel.<br> The little troll rocked back and forth &#x2014; blown about by gusts of air-conditioning and wind, smiling an idiotic smile.<br> Why were trolls always smiling, anyway?<br> Every troll Beverly had ever seen had a gigantic smile plastered on its face for absolutely no good reason.<br> When they got to the city limits, Beverly said, &#x201c;You can let me out anywhere.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Well, where are you headed?&#x201d; said Joe Travis. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take you there.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going anywhere,&#x201d; said Beverly. &#x201c;Let me out.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t got to be so secretive.

Cars went zooming past her, leaving behind hot gusts of metallic air.<br> She saw a sign with a pink seahorse painted on it. She stopped. She stared at the seahorse. He was smiling and chubby-cheeked. There were a lot of little bubbles coming out of his mouth, and then one big bubble that had the words seahorse court, an rv community written inside of it.<br> Past the sign, there was a ground-up seashell drive that led to a bunch of trailers. A woman was standing in front of a pink trailer holding a hose, spraying a sad bunch of flowers.<br> The woman raised her hand and waved. &#x201c;Howdy, howdy!&#x201d; she shouted.<br> &#x201c;Right,&#x201d; said Beverly. &#x201c;Howdy.&#x201d;<br> She started walking again.

His frank, lucid observations along the way - on race relations, labor, the Tennessee Valley Authority, farm life, the politics of the big cities, and much else - yield fascinating insight into life fifty years ago. Now, on the brink of the millennium, this fiftieth anniversary edition of Inside U.S.A. provides an invaluable picture of America as it was then, both for those old enough to remember it and for young people who may be astonished to see the ways the country has changed."America," Winston Churchill said, "stands at this moment at the summit of the world." The moment was August, 1945. Nazi Germany had fallen, the atomic bomb had been dropped, imperial Japan was about to surrender, the European Allies were battered and spent, and the United States bestrode the narrow world. It was a new America, hardly known to the world--or to itself. This was the America that John Gunther portrayed in the vivid and acute reportage of <i>Inside U.S.A.,</i> which is to be reissued this month by the New Press. <p> This book, now half a century old, is an astonishing tour de force. It presents a shrewd, fast-moving, sparkling panorama of the United States at this historic moment of apparent triumph. . . . </p><p> <i>Inside U.S.A.</i> does not pretend to be a profound analysis of American civilization, in the manner of Tocqueville and Bryce. But Gunther had his own quiver of penetrating questions. His objective was to identify the forces that made "this incomparable Golconda of a country" move. Wherever he went, he asked, Who runs this state or city? What are the basic and irreversible sources of power--social power, economic power, political power? He interviewed more than 900 people and emerged with more than a million words of notes.

From the first verse of Genesis, the book of origins, we encounter a God of personality, character, purpose, and activity. Only in the light of what he shows us of himself as the Creator of our world and the Interactor with human history does the salvation story assume its proper context. Genesis sets things in order: God first, then us. In the words of the general editor&#x2019;s preface, &#x201c;Especially after the Tower of Babel it became evident that people had forgotten who God was. They needed reminding. The moves God made were essentially concerned with putting himself in front of the world&#x2019;s peoples.&#x201d; Today, perhaps more than ever, we need God to put himself in front of us&#x2015;to remind us who he is, and that he is. With characteristic creativity and uncommon depth, John H. Walton demonstrates the timeless relevance of Genesis. Revealing the links between Genesis and our own times, Dr. Walton shows how this mysterious, often baffling book filled with obscure peoples and practices reveals truth to guide our twenty-first-century lives. Most Bible commentaries take us on a one-way trip from our world to the world of the Bible. But they leave us there, assuming that we can somehow make the return journey on our own. They focus on the original meaning of the passage but don&#x2019;t discuss its contemporary application. The information they offer is valuable&#x2015;but the job is only half done! The NIV Application Commentary Series helps bring both halves of the interpretive task together. This unique, award-winning series shows readers how to bring an ancient message into our postmodern context. It explains not only what the Bible meant but also how it speaks powerfully today.This series promises to become an indispensable tool for every pastor and teacher who seeks to make the Bible's timeless message speak to this generation.

What is the significance of God as the creator of time? Time was a part of a cosmos that was judged as good; yet, because death is in the system, we often consider time an enemy. Even a casual glance at the birthday-card section at the local supermarket shows the recognition of the negative aspects connected with the relentless march of time. We mark the passing of personal time with mixtures of celebration and remorse. Celebration comes when we reach age sixteen and can drive, or when we reach twenty-one and can be considered full-fledged adults. Comedians joke about being perpetually thirty-nine, and during the 1960s the young generation was advised not to trust anyone over thirty. By the time we reach forty or fifty, the black balloons begin showing up. On a social level, each new year is observed as time ticks on, and the changeover of a millennium takes on epic proportions. Time passes whether we want it to or not, forming the parameters of our existence and taking its toll. On the other side of the ledger, each of us has probably had the sensation of being awakened from a deep sleep and experiencing on our grogginess the total disorientation that comes from not being able to identify the day or time. We find it difficult to carry on existence in the absence of time indicators. Prisoners in POW camps mark the days of their captivity in any way available to them so as not to lose some sense of orientation in time. If the conditions of imprisonment do not afford the ability to observe whether it is day or night, the delivery of meals can become a marker. We need to feel oriented in time. For good or ill, then, time is out reality. Ecclesiastes 3:1-8 explores this reality as it enumerates the "times" of life. In the world that God had created "under the sun," we must learn to accept the good times and the bad times as coming from the hand of God, for even the bad times can enrich us as God&#x2019;s people (Eccl. 7:14). And although he has locked us in time for now, he has set eternity in our hearts...." "The text often touches on, rather than teaches on, certain issues. These arise in our minds as we read the text, but we discover that the text offers no information about them. In that sense, they constitute digressions from the text. They should not be the focus of an expository sermon or Bible-study lesson in that they do not represent the focus of the text; nevertheless, they can offer opportunities for fruitful discussion concerning our theology or worldview. I will address these as "break-out points: so as to distinguish them from the Contemporary Significance sections that seek to address issues that the text consciously addresses. These can be nothing more than my reflection, for the text of Genesis has nothing normative to say about them. For example, in this passage our thoughts could easily wander to the question of our stewardship of time. If time is one of the functions that God has set up in this world of ours, perhaps we should consider carefully the best ways to use our time. In the foreword of Neil Postman&#x2019;s book Amusing Ourselves to Death, he compares the apocalyptic visions of George Orwell (1984) to those of Aldous Huxley (Brave New World). One of the comparisons speaks to the issue at hand: "In 1984... people are controlled by infliction pain. In Brave New World, they are controlled be inflicting pleasure. In short, Orwell feared that what we hate will ruin us. Huxley feared that what we love will ruin us." Our time is filled with those things we love. In the process we can easily lose sight of important things such as service, accountability, and duty, which commend themselves as more responsible discharges of the valuable commodity of time. In his assessment of the role of television in American society, Postman notes that it has "made entertainment itself the natural format for the representation of all experience." This has inculcated in us an unquenchable lust to be entertained, and we are happy to contribute large proportions of out time to the quest. Postman&#x2019;s conclusion holds little optimism as it looks ahead to the fate we have chosen for ourselves. When a population becomes distracted by trivia, when cultural life is redefined as a perpetual round of entertainments, when serious public conversation becomes a form of baby-talk, when, in short, a people become an audience and their public business a vaudeville act, then a nation finds itself at risk; culture-death is a clear possibility...."</p><h2>Free Soil, Free Labor, Free Men: The Ideology of the Republican Party before the Civil War</h2><p>Since its publication twenty-five years ago, <em>Free Soil, Free Labor, Free Men</em> has been recognized as a classic, an indispensable contribution to our understanding of the causes of the American Civil War. A key work in establishing political ideology as a major concern of modern American historians, it remains the only full-scale evaluation of the ideas of the early Republican party. Now with a new introduction, Eric Foner puts his argument into the context of contemporary scholarship, reassessing the concept of free labor in the light of the last twenty-five years of writing on such issues as work, gender, economic change, and political thought.<br><br>A significant reevaluation of the causes of the Civil War, Foner's study looks beyond the North's opposition to slavery and its emphasis upon preserving the Union to determine the broader grounds of its willingness to undertake a war against the South in 1861. Its search is for those social concepts the North accepted as vital to its way of life, finding these concepts most clearly expressed in the ideology of the growing Republican party in the decade before the war's start. Through a careful analysis of the attitudes of leading factions in the party's formation (northern Whigs, former Democrats, and political abolitionists) Foner is able to show what each contributed to Republican ideology. He also shows how northern ideas of human rights--in particular a man's right to work where and how he wanted, and to accumulate property in his own name--and the goals of American society were implicit in that ideology. This was the ideology that permeated the North in the period directly before the Civil War, led to the election of Abraham Lincoln, and led, almost immediately, to the Civil War itself. At the heart of the controversy over the extension of slavery, he argues, is the issue of whether the northern or southern form of society would take root in the West, whose development would determine the nation's destiny.<br><br>In his new introductory essay, Foner presents a greatly altered view of the subject. Only entrepreneurs and farmers were actually "free men" in the sense used in the ideology of the period. Actually, by the time the Civil War was initiated, half the workers in the North were wage-earners, not independent workers. And this did not account for women and blacks, who had little freedom in choosing what work they did. He goes onto show that even after the Civil War these guarantees for "free soil, free labor, free men" did not really apply for most Americans, and especially not for blacks. <br><br>Demonstrating the profoundly successful fusion of value and interest within Republican ideology prior to the Civil War, <em>Free Soil, Free Labor, Free Men</em> remains a classic of modern American historical writing. Eloquent and influential, it shows how this ideology provided the moral consensus which allowed the North, for the first time in history, to mobilize an entire society in modern warfare.<br></p><p><br><strong>Eric Foner</strong> is Professor of History at Columbia University, and author of <em>Tom Paine and Revolutionary America</em> and <em>Politics and Ideology in the Age of the Civil War</em>.<br><br>"First-rate in every respect...[A] work of genuine distinction, and a major contribution to ante-bellum political history."--Kenneth Stampp, author of <em>The Imperiled Union</em><p></p><br>"Still the best book on the politics of the 1850's."--Norman B.

In 1846 eighty-seven people -- men, women, and children -- set out for California, persuaded to attempt a new overland route. After struggling across the desert, losing many oxen, and nearly dying of thirst, they reached the very summit of the Sierras, only to be trapped by blinding snow and bitter storms. Many perished; some survived by resorting to cannibalism; all were subjected to unbearable suffering. Incorporating the diaries of the survivors and other contemporary documents, George Stewart wrote the definitive history of that ill-fated band of pioneers; an astonishing account of what human beings may endure and achieve in the final press of circumstance.</p><p>George R. Stewart (1895-1980) taught for more than fifty years at the University of California, Berkeley. He is the author of Pickett&#39;s Charge, Earth Abides, and numerous other books of history, biography, and fiction.The Donner Party went west in 1846, relying on a shyster&#39;s faulty map. When they were trapped by early snow in the Sierra Nevadas, they turned to cannibalism to stay alive. Expertly read by Jeff Riggenbach, the tale retains its freshness and power 150 years later. Riggenbach reads the stark story with authority, clarity and richness.

Still as relevant today as they were over two thousand years ago, these teachings together present a moral code that values virtue above all, and make up the core values of the Confucian tradition.&nbsp;<br><br> This edition includes a full introduction that gives the social and political background of the ancient work, analyses of key terms in Chinese thought, and a careful study of the history of the book and its interpretations. There are also full notes illuminating the references to contemporary events and clarifying obscure passages. An essential work of literature and philosophy,&nbsp;<i>The Analects of Confucius</i>&nbsp;has shaped generations of readers around the world.</p><p>The Analects of Confucius is one of the central books of Chinese literature and Chinese thought; memorized and studied for many centuries, it has been certainly one of the most influential books in world history. There are many translations of this rewarding but difficult work. Arthur Waley -- the translator of the Tale of Genji, of a vast body of Chinese poetry, and of many other classics of Oriental literature and thought -- brings to this translation his great gifts as a scholar and a writer, and has produced what is without question the best version in English of the Analects. A full introduction gives the social and political background of this work, analyses of key terms in Chinese thought that are prominent in it, and a careful study of the history of the book and its interpretations. There are also full notes illuminating the references to contemporary events and clarifying obscure passages.A renowned translator and critic, Arthur Waley was born in 1889 and educated at Rugby, King&#x2019;s College, Cambridge. From 1912-30 he was the assistant keeper of prints and drawings at the British Museum. He is credited with bringing many classic works of Chinese and Japanese literature (including<i> The Tale of Genji</i>) to Western readers for the first time. Arthur Waley died in 1966.</p><h2>Left of Karl Marx: The Political Life of Black Communist Claudia Jones</h2><p>In <i>Left of Karl Marx</i>, Carole Boyce Davies assesses the activism, writing, and legacy of Claudia Jones (1915&#x2013;1964), a pioneering Afro-Caribbean radical intellectual, dedicated communist, and feminist. Jones is buried in London&#x2019;s Highgate Cemetery, to the left of Karl Marx&#x2014;a location that Boyce Davies finds fitting given how Jones expanded Marxism-Leninism to incorporate gender and race in her political critique and activism. <p></p><p>Claudia Cumberbatch Jones was born in Trinidad. In 1924, she moved to New York, where she lived for the next thirty years. She was active in the Communist Party from her early twenties onward. A talented writer and speaker, she traveled throughout the United States lecturing and organizing. In the early 1950s, she wrote a well-known column, &#x201c;Half the World,&#x201d; for the <i>Daily Worker</i>. As the U.S. government intensified its efforts to prosecute communists, Jones was arrested several times. She served nearly a year in a U.S. prison before being deported and given asylum by Great Britain in 1955. There she founded <i>The West Indian Gazette and Afro-Asian Caribbean News</i> and the Caribbean Carnival, an annual London festival that continues today as the Notting Hill Carnival. Boyce Davies examines Jones&#x2019;s thought and journalism, her political and community organizing, and poetry that the activist wrote while she was imprisoned. Looking at the contents of the FBI file on Jones, Boyce Davies contrasts Jones&#x2019;s own narration of her life with the federal government&#x2019;s. <i>Left of Karl Marx</i> establishes Jones as a significant figure within Caribbean intellectual traditions, black U.S. feminism, and the history of communism.</p></p><p>&#34;Carole Boyce Davies has vividly brought to life the work and struggles of Claudia Jones in the U.S.A. and Great Britain in her new book, &#34;Left of Karl Marx.&#34; Boyce Davies possesses that unique combination of being both a scholarly researcher and a writer capable of clear and persuasive language. The reader is presented with a remarkably readable and informative study of a woman who was equally adept in her writing and public speaking on feminism, and as a social pioneer, a political analyst, and an avowed adversary of racism. This book removes Claudia Jones from the shadow of the great bust of Marx to the front row of the black activists and thinkers of the twentieth century, and that is where she belongs.&#34;--Donald Hinds, author of &#34;Journey to an Illusion: The West Indian in Britain&#34;<p>Carole Boyce Davies is Professor of African&#x2013;New World Studies and English at Florida International University.

Climbing the rickety ladder to decorate the nine-foot Christmas tree was definitely the lesser of two evils.<br> <br>Lance was five months into a six-month sentence at the San Leandro County Juvenile Justice Center facility in the Hill Country some fifty miles northwest of Austin. All his life he had hated having a December birthday&#x2014;hated having whatever he was getting for his birthday and Christmas lumped into a single gift that never measured up to what other kids got. This year, though, his turning eighteen on December 18 meant that Lance would be out of jail in time for Christmas&#x2014;out and able to go home. The problem with that, of course, was that he might not have a home to go to.<br> <br>The last time he&#x2019;d seen his mother, on visiting day two weeks ago, she had told him that she was probably going to lose the house. She&#x2019;d finally admitted to him that she&#x2019;d had to take out a second mortgage in order to pay the king&#x2019;s ransom he owed in court-ordered restitution. Now that her hours had been cut back at work, she wasn&#x2019;t able to keep up the payments on both mortgages. Which meant that, most likely, the house would go into foreclosure.<br> <br>That was all his fault, too. Ears reddening with shame, Lance climbed down the ladder, moved it a few inches toward the next undecorated section of branches, picked up another tray of decorations, and clambered back up.<br> <br>Don&#x2019;t think about it, he told himself firmly. What was it the counselor kept saying? Don&#x2019;t waste your time worrying about things you can&#x2019;t change.<br> <br>This definitely fell into the category of stuff that couldn&#x2019;t be changed. What&#x2019;s done was done.<br> <br>He heard a burst of laughter from the classroom. It was just off the dining room. The kids were probably giving Mrs. Stone hell again. He felt sorry for her. She seemed like a nice enough person, and he knew she was genuinely trying to help them. But what she was offering&#x2014;course work leading up to earning a GED&#x2014;wasn&#x2019;t at all what Lance wanted. It had never been part of what he had envisioned as his own future.<br> <br>A year ago, just last May, his future had been promising. As a high school junior honor student at San Leandro High, Lance had been enrolled in three Advanced Placement classes and had done well on his SATs, coming in with a respectable 2290. With the help of his beloved math teacher, Mr. Jackson, Lance had been preparing to lead his computer science club team to their third consecutive championship for that year&#x2019;s Longhorn computer science competition.<br> <br>Now his life had changed, and not for the better. Mr. Jackson was dead. Lance&#x2019;s mother had told him that San Leandro High had won the Longhorn trophy after all, but without Lance&#x2019;s help, because someone else was the team captain now. As for doing his senior year in the top 10 percent of his class and getting to wear whatever he wanted to school? That had changed, too. Now Lance found himself locked up twenty-four hours a day and with nothing to wear but orange jumpsuits. The state of Texas offered college scholarships to kids in the top 10 percent of their respective classes, but he wouldn&#x2019;t be able to take advantage of that, either. Lance was now officially considered to be a high school dropout with an institution-earned GED as his best possible educational outcome. No matter what his SAT score said, trying to get into Texas A&amp;M, or any college, with only a lowly GED to his credit wasn&#x2019;t going to work.<br> <br>The problem was that the GED class was the only one offered inside the facility. Some of the other kids were able to take online classes, but since Lance&#x2019;s sentence stipulated no computer or Internet access, those classes weren&#x2019;t available to him. His court-mandated restrictions made the GED the only route possible. It was also boring as hell.<br> <br>Lance had looked at the questions on the sample test. He already knew he could ace the thing in a heartbeat without having to sit through another dreary minute of class. Mrs. Stone probably understood that as well as he did. That was why she had let him out of class yesterday and today. That way he got to deal with the Christmas-tree issue, and she got to look after the dummies. Not that his classmates were really dumb, at least not all of them. Several of the guys spoke no English. He suspected that several of them probably had issues with dyslexia. One of those, a fifteen-year-old named Jason who couldn&#x2019;t read at all, filled his books with caricatures of Mrs. Stone. The pencil drawings were realistic enough in that you could tell who it was. They were also unrealistic in that Mrs. Stone was usually pictured nude, and not in a nice way.<br> <br>All of which left Lance dealing with the Christmas tree. It was big and came in four separate pieces. It was old&#x2014;ten years, at least, according to Mr. Dunn, the grizzled old black man who was in charge of maintenance at the facility. He was the one who had enlisted Lance&#x2019;s help to drag the tree and the boxes of decorations out of storage.<br> <br>&#x201c;No money for a new tree,&#x201d; Mr. Dunn said. &#x201c;Not in the budget, but at least I got us some new lights. By the time we took the tree down last year, half those old lights had quit working. We&#x2019;ll have to restring it before we put it up.&#x201d;<br> <br>That part of the project had taken the better part of a day. First they&#x2019;d removed the old strings of lights. Then they&#x2019;d taken the new ones out of their boxes and wound them into the branches, carefully positioning the plug-in ends close enough to the tree trunk so that all the lights could be fastened together easily once the pieces were dropped into place. It was time-consuming, tedious work, but Lance liked the careful way Mr. Dunn went about it, his methodical method of testing each new string of lights before letting Lance take them out of the box. &#x201c;No sense in putting on a defective string that won&#x2019;t light up the first time you plug it in,&#x201d; Mr. Dunn muttered under his breath.<br> <br>The way Mr. Dunn talked as he worked, more to himself than to anyone else, reminded Lance of Grandpa Frank, his father&#x2019;s father back in Arizona. Lance missed Grandpa Frank, but his grandfather, along with his entire collection of aunts, uncles, and cousins, had disappeared when his parents got a divorce. It wasn&#x2019;t fair. Just because parents couldn&#x2019;t get along shouldn&#x2019;t mean that the poor kids involved had to lose everybody.<br> <br>Lance&#x2019;s favorite memory of Grandpa Frank was going with him to the state fair in Phoenix, where he ate so much cotton candy that he ended up getting sick on the Ferris wheel. The attendant had given him hell while cleaning up the mess. At the time, Lance had been beyond embarrassed, but Grandpa Frank had laughed it off. &#x201c;Look,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Crap happens. You clean up your own mess, tell the world to piss off, and get on with your life. You want some more cotton candy?&#x201d;<br> <br>Lance had not wanted any more cotton candy. Ever. And he wished he&#x2019;d been able to talk to Grandpa Frank after he got into trouble. His advice probably would have been a lot like some of the things the counselor said, only more colorful. Unfortunately, sometime between the divorce and now, Grandpa Frank had dropped dead of a heart attack or maybe a stroke. Lance didn&#x2019;t know for sure. If his parents had been able to talk to each other, Lance might have had more information&#x2014;might even have been able to go back to Phoenix for the funeral&#x2014;but that didn&#x2019;t happen. Grandpa Frank was gone without Lance even being able to say goodbye.<br> <br>&#x201c;You gonna hand me another string of them lights?&#x201d; Mr. Dunn asked. &#x201c;Or are you gonna stand there all day staring into space?&#x201d;<br> <br>Jarred out of his Grandpa Frank reverie, Lance fumbled another string of lights out of a box and plugged it in to the outlet. The new one lit right up, just as they all had, but as Mr. Dunn said, &#x201c;Better safe than sorry.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know prelit trees could be so much trouble,&#x201d; Lance remarked.<br> <br>&#x201c;They are if you think you can keep &#x2019;em forever,&#x201d; Mr. Dunn replied, &#x201c;but with budgets as tight as they are, we&#x2019;re lucky to get the new lights.&#x201d;<br> <br>When the tree was finally upright and glowing with hundreds of brand-new multicolored lights, Mr. Dunn studied it for a moment and then shook his head. &#x201c;Tomorrow&#x2019;s my day off. Ms. Stone tells me you&#x2019;re gonna be the one putting on the decorations.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lance shrugged. &#x201c;Fine with me,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Before I take off tonight, I&#x2019;ll leave everything you need in the closet next to my office, and I&#x2019;ll make sure the guy who comes in tomorrow knows what&#x2019;s what. The flocking&#x2019;s looking pretty sorry these days. I got us some glitter and some self-adhesive glue. Before you put on the decorations, spray some glue on the tree and toss some glitter on it. That&#x2019;s supposed to make it look a little better.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Lance said. &#x201c;Will do.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mr. Dunn turned to him. &#x201c;You seem like a good kid,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Not like some of them other ornery ones. What the hell are you doing here?&#x201d;<br> <br>Lance bit his lip. That was the whole problem: He was a good kid. He never should have been locked up here, but he didn&#x2019;t want to go into it, not with this old man. &#x201c;Long story,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>Mr. Dunn shook his head sadly. &#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t they all!&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>Which brought Lance to the next day, when he was working on his own. Marvin Cotton, one of the guards, had opened the door to the closet next to Mr. Dunn&#x2019;s office. Had Mr. Dunn been there, he for sure would have helped Lance carry all the stuff into the rec room. Marvin was only a couple of years older than Lance. The guy was thick-necked, stupid, and surly, and he probably didn&#x2019;t have a college degree. He wandered in and out of the rec room from time to time to check on things, without saying a word or even nodding in Lance&#x2019;s direction. But then there were plenty of guards who acted like that&#x2014;who treated the prisoners as something less than human.<br> <br>Rather than worry about Marvin, Lance concentrated on the tree. For as long as he could remember, decorating Christmas trees had been high on his list of favorite things to do. Not this time. At home, they always had a live tree, although his mother usually bought them late on Christmas Eve, when they were already marked down and cheap. That meant that the trees they had were the rejects&#x2014;scrawny, uneven, and downright ugly, but his mom made sure they always did the decorating together: all four of them, Lance, his mom, and his two younger brothers, Connor and Thad. Connor was only six and believed in Santa Claus. Lance and Thad no longer had that option. At home, decorating the tree was a joyous occasion with laughter and joking around and plenty of popcorn and homemade cookies. Here, although it was a solitary chore, it was preferable to suffering through the agonies of Mrs. Stone&#x2019;s class.<br> <br>A few people besides Marvin had come and gone while Lance worked, so he didn&#x2019;t turn to look when the metal door clicked open behind him. Intent on having lost the wire hanger to one of the Christmas balls, he was staring into the tree branch, trying to find it, when he heard an unexpected hissing from the glue can he had left on the table with the other decorations. Just as quickly, he felt the cold in his legs as the aerosol spray hit, freezing his pant legs to his skin. Lance glanced down then. &#x201c;Hey!&#x201d; he demanded. &#x201c;What the hell do you think you&#x2019;re doing?&#x201d;<br> <br>All he could see below him was a hand holding one of the spray cans of glue. Then a second hand came into his line of vision. It took a moment for his brain to register what he was seeing. The second hand held a cigarette lighter. Lance had time enough to register the flash of flame from the lighter, then the very air around him seemed to explode in flame. Writhing in pain, he attempted to lean over and pat out the fire on his legs. That was enough to tip the shaky ladder. The next thing Lance knew, he was falling and burning.<br> <br>Mercifully, for a long time after that, he remembered nothing.</p><h2>Becoming a Problem Solving Genius: A Handbook of Math Strategies</h2><p>Every math student needs a tool belt of problem solving strategies to call upon when solving word problems.

Ecological changes made these landscapes especially suitable for the vector mosquitoes of yellow fever and malaria, and these diseases wrought systematic havoc among armies and would-be settlers. Because yellow fever confers immunity on survivors of the disease, and because malaria confers resistance, these diseases played partisan roles in the struggles for empire and revolution, attacking some populations more severely than others. In particular, yellow fever and malaria attacked newcomers to the region, which helped keep the Spanish Empire Spanish in the face of predatory rivals in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. In the late eighteenth and through the nineteenth century, these diseases helped revolutions to succeed by decimating forces sent out from Europe to prevent them.</p><p>This book explores the links among ecology, disease, and international politics in the context of the Greater Caribbean in the seventeenth through early twentieth centuries.

How did they come to inhabit the island? How long will they remain? </p><p>Thoroughly researched and filled with intricate and beautiful paintings, this extraordinary book by Award-winning author and artist Jason Chin is an epic saga of the life of an island&#x2015;born of fire, rising to greatness, its decline, and finally the emergence of life on new islands. Chin's approach makes this book a must-have common core tool for teachers and librarians introducing scientific principals to young students.</p><p><i>Island </i>is one of <i>Kirkus Reviews' </i>Best Children's Books of 2012</p></p><p>Jason Chin is the author and artist of the Roaring Brook titles <i>Coral Reefs</i> and the award-winning <i>Redwoods</i>, which Kirkus Reviews called, "an inventive eye-opening adventure."

It's a biography. It begins with an island's "birth" six million years ago. "A volcano has been growing under the ocean for millions of years," Chin writes. "With this eruption it rises above the water for the first time, and a new island is born." In full-page watercolor paintings and small-size panel illustrations, Chin shows how the tremendous explosion leaves a mass of lava, which hardens and grows into an island. Any reader who has ever made a homemade "volcano" out of baking soda will be hooked. Writing scientific narrative nonfiction for young children is challenge enough, but creating engaging picture books for older children about the natural world isn't easy either. How to pull in the "Diary of a Wimpy Kid" reader? Credit to Jason Chin, who succeeded at both in "Coral Reefs" (2011) and "Redwoods" (2009). He does so again in his latest, "Island: A Story of the Gal�pagos." Chin, as author-illustrator, melds geology with evolution, showing how the land and its inhabitants interact and shape one another in a natural-world interplay. We see how a few intrepid immigrant animals arrive, colonize and transform themselves to accommodate the particular features of their new home. The island grows and changes too as new eruptions lead to the appearance of other nearby islands, while eruptions on the original island grow infrequent, and then cease. ...a remarkable work and an asset for educators...&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly, starred</i></p><p>&#x201c;Chin's gorgeous illustrations include sweeping double-page spreads of the island and its inhabitants...&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Horn Book Magazine, starred</i></p><p>&#x201c;Another superb contribution to scientific literature by Chin.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus, starred</i></p><p>&#x201c;...this fine introduction to [the Gal�pagos] will surely stimulate readers' interest.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>School Library Journal, starred</i></p><p>&#x201c;The art is masterful in its combination of realism and artistic flow; the layout complements sweeping full-page, full-bleed landscapes with carefully controlled panel sequences that provide additional focus on a process or creature, so the evolution of larger finches' beaks, for instance, is clearly demonstrated and explained.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>BCCB, starred review</i></p></p><h2>Jenny Goes to Sea</h2><p>In <i>Jenny Goes to Sea</i>, our heroine makes her passage on the good ship Sea Queen with her master, Captain Tinker, and her adopted brothers, tiger cat Edward, and black-and-white cat Checkers.

Esther Averill would eventually write twelve more tales about Miss Linsky and her friends (including the I Can Read Book, <i>The Fire Cat</i>), each of which was eagerly awaited by children all over the United States (and their parents, too)."We never can get enough of Jenny, one of our favorite literary cats.

When Laurence Waters arrives at the small rural hospital in a South African homeland where Frank works, Frank is immediately suspicious. Everything about Laurence grates on Frank, from his smoking in their shared room, to his unfamiliar optimism about what the doctors can truly accomplish among the local population but Laurence seems oblivious, immediately and repeatedly declaring Frank his friend despite the other's indifference. Frank originally came to the hospital to get his bearings after his wife left him for his best friend but denial of the higher-level post he was promised when he came, and the disillusionment of working at a completely ineffectual hospital (it&#x2019;s always deserted, an entire wing closed off and gradually being looted of any reusable equipment lacks basic supplies), has hardened him into cynical apathy which makes Laurence&#x2019;s optimism all the more irritating.<br><br>Laurence starts planning a campaign to bring the hospital to the people,&#x201d; by running clinics in nearby villages. A group of soldiers have arrived in the village, reportedly looking for holes in the border where smuggling has become rampant. Then Laurence&#x2019;s African-American girlfriend Zanele, who has adopted an African name and dress, and who shares his political idealism (but not much actual intimacy, it seems) comes to visit, and Laurence and Frank host a party. During the flush of drunkenness the tensions between the staff melt away (the Cuban couple estranged by Frank having had an affair with the woman; the strained power relations between Frank and the other doctors and Tehogo, the young black African man who works as the caretaker and unlicensed nurse). But in the aftermath of the party this quickly melts away especially when Frank goes to return the cassettes Tehogo lent him for the party, and accidentally discovers a cache of looted metal fittings from the hospital in Tehogo&#x2019;s room. Finally, Laurence talks Frank into spending an evening with Zanele while he is on duty which ends in a bizarre encounter with an apartheid-era local despot and a furtive sexual union with Zanele. Frank is understandably relieved that a few days later an appointment to see his estranged wife to sign divorce papers allows him a chance to get away.<br><br>When Frank returns, Laurence meets him by telling him everything&#x2019;s changed. Laurence has ignored Frank&#x2019;s wish not to report Tehogo&#x2019;s theft, and in so doing has revealed that Frank was the one who discovered it. The clinic has become a huge public relations coup, raising awareness and goodwill toward the hospital though its capacities are no better than before, and everyone but Frank seems swept up in its success. And a secret Frank has been keeping from Laurence since their first day of friendship the married poor black woman Frank has been sleeping with off and on for years, sometimes for money comes to light, in a way, when the woman comes to Laurence at the end of the clinic to tell him she needs an abortion, and that it must be done at her home. Enjoying Laurence&#x2019;s discomfort with this moral dilemma, Frank does not help with the procedure and when he guiltily goes to check on the patient the next night, she and the shack where she lived, where he would go to meet her, are gone. Meanwhile Tehogo has more or less completely stopped coming in to work. Convinced that his affair&#x2019;s husband is somehow linked to the former despot and to a rash of recent robberies because of his white car, Frank tips the colonel leading the group of soldiers a brutal Afrikaner under whom, as a conscript, Frank had been forced to help torture black informants before the end of apartheid as to where he thinks the despot&#x2019;s encampment is hiding. Soon after, a soldier turns up with Tehogo, vitally wounded from a gunshot. As Frank tends to the wound obsessively to assuage his guilt at possibly having exposed Tehogo to the colonel, Laurence for once is completely apathetic whether disgusted at Tehogo for being a thief and complicating his image of human perfectibility, or too distracted by the apparently more noble work of tomorrow&#x2019;s second village health clinic, which seems more than ever to Frank like lip service. Frank volunteers to move Tehogo to the bigger hospital where his life can assuredly be saved, but when he wakes in the morning Tehogo, the soldier guarding him, the bed to which he was handcuffed, and Laurence, who was on night duty, are all gone. Soon the soldiers leave town too, and as the stultifying silence of the pre-Laurence days returns, Frank is left to make some sense of the strange almost-year of the young doctor&#x2019;s presence.<br></p><p>"Galgut's prose, its gentle rhythms and straightforward sentences edging toward revelation, is utterly seductive and suspenseful....

Laurence is everything Frank is not - young, optimistic, and full of new schemes. The two become uneasy friends, while the rest of the meagre staff in the deserted hospital view Laurence with a mixture of awe and mistrust. <br>The tired, ghostly town beyond the hospital is also coping with new arrivals, and the return of old faces. The Brigadier, a self-fashioned dictator from apartheid days, is rumoured to be still alive.

Laurence wants to help - but in a world where the past is demanding restitution from the present, his ill-starred idealism cannot last.</p><h2>Refugee Tales</h2><p>Two unaccompanied children travel across the Mediterranean in an overcrowded boat that has been designed to only make it halfway across...&nbsp;A 63-year-old man is woken one morning by border officers &#x2018;acting on a tip-off&#x2019; and, despite having paid taxes for 28 years, is suddenly cast into the detention system with no obvious means of escape...&nbsp;An orphan whose entire life has been spent in slavery &#x2013; first on a Ghanaian farm, then as a victim of trafficking &#x2013; writes to the Home Office for help, only to be rewarded with a jail sentence and indefinite detention...&nbsp;These are not fictions.

Without them I would be lost.</p><li>My relationship with my denim hotpants is incredibly special. I pack them in my hand luggage when I travel because I fear that one day we will be separated and I will be forced to go out bottomless forevermore because no other shorts will ever be able to replace them. Since the day I found them lurking in a Brixton charity shop we have become so inseparable that even when I take them off they still retain the shape of my bum as they lie on my bedroom floor. I use them to dress down a flashy top, as a practical alternative to muddy trousers at festivals, and over the years have cut them shorter and shorter so that they are now borderline obscene (they keep getting cheekier). Until the denim disintegrates and falls off me, these particular hotpants are here to stay.</li><li>A navy blue jumper is potentially the most boring item anyone could design and yet it&#x2019;s my most important possession. The one I own belongs to an ex-boyfriend, and before shops caught on and made &#x2018;boyfriend-fit jeans&#x2019; and &#x2018;boyfriend sweaters&#x2019; everyone was happily throwing on their actual boyfriend&#x2019;s belongings to keep warm. I have never travelled without it and it has rescued me from many mornings of outfit panic. Once when I was heartbroken a male friend of mine sent me his navy cashmere jumper to wear as a perpetual hug to cheer me up. It worked.</li><li>My Burberry trench coat is something I saved up for a long time to buy. When I wear it I feel like a French detective from the sixties. Yet I love how quintessentially British it is, in that it&#x2019;s practical yet proper. It was either this or a cagoule. I think I made the right choice.</li><li>Every woman needs s a transportable receptacle to shove her collection of clutter into, and as much as I love some It Bag arm candy I am just as happy to pile everything into a canvas tote. Sometimes I wish I could live like a man and fit everything I need into a single back pocket but that&#x2019;s never going to happen and besides, then I would lose out on the daily drama that occurs when I think I&#x2019;ve lost something and have to tip the contents of my bag out only to discover my phone is in my hand. I think a canvas tote bag is as classic as a Chanel 2.55 and the bonus is you can shove it in a washing machine without having a mental breakdown.</li><li>I thought I could narrow it down to five items I couldn&#x2019;t live without but I can&#x2019;t, so: ankle boots because you can wear them with literally anything. A pair of Wayfarer sunglasses&#x2014;wear at night to seem extra aloof. Ballet flats&#x2014;I can&#x2019;t dance but that doesn&#x2019;t stop me from trying. Dungarees&#x2014;it&#x2019;s fine that only toddlers and me like these.

Adler a "philosopher for everyman." In this guide to considering the big questions, Adler addresses the topics all men and women ponder in the course of life, such as "What is love?", "How do we decide the right thing to do?", and, "What does it mean to be good?" Drawing on his extensive knowledge of Western literature, history, and philosophy, the author considers what is meant by democracy, law, emotion, language, truth, and other abstract concepts in light of more than two millennia of Western civilization and discourse. Adler's essays offer a remarkable and contemplative distillation of the Great Ideas of Western Thought.<br></p><p>Mortimer J. Adler was an American philosopher who lived from 1902 to 2001. He was the author of over sixty books, one of them entitled How to Think about God, and the editor of hundreds of books. He was a major force in promoting the &#34;&#34;&#34;&#34;Great Books&#34;&#34;&#34;&#34; idea as an educational paradigm. He founded the Institute for Philosophical Research, launched the Paidea movement for educational reform, and revolutionized the Encyclopedia Britannica.Decades before Allan Bloom famously attacked multicultural education in The Closing of the American Mind (1988), there was Mortimer Adler. A university-trained philosopher, Adler (b. 1902) is the controversy-prone inventor of Great Books-driven college curricula; during the 1930s, he caused such a stir at the University of Chicago that the faculty members demanded his dismissal. Later (1953-1954), he starred in his own TV show, The Great Ideas--and it's that show that gives this book its structure. Composed of transcripts of 52 half-hour segments, the book showcases Adler's ideas about all the big categories--truth, beauty, freedom, love, sex, art, justice, rationality, humankind's nature, Darwinism, government. In each chapter ("How to Think about God," "How to Read a Book," etc.), readers encounter Adler's philosophical instructions and opinions: he argues that the goal of both prison sentences and spankings should be to avenge, to reform and to deter others; he suggests that beauty is not just in the eye of the beholder; and--no surprise here--he confesses that he favors "the ancient and traditional meaning of art." Adler even takes up the subject of whether (and how) TV can be an effective educational tool. In the end, whether or not you agree with Adler, there's no question that the ideas he presents in these chapters are important. After all, they set the terms of a series of cultural and intellectual debates we're still having today--about art, curriculum and freedom.

If your last experience of American history was brought to you by junior-high-school textbooks--or even if you're a specialist--get ready for the other side of stories you may not even have heard. With its vivid descriptions of rarely noted events, <i>The Twentieth Century</i> is required reading for anyone who wants to take a fresh look at America's legacy as a world power.<p>Howard Zinn (1922&#x2013;2010) was a historian, playwright, and social activist.

One of the best birders in England, Tom had put the village of Rushy on the birdwatching map. Everyone liked him. Or did they? George Palmer-Jones, an elderly birdwatcher who decided quietly to look into the brutal crime, discovered mixed feelings aplenty. Still, he remained baffled by a deed that could have been motivated by thwarted love, pure envy, or something else altogether. But as he and his fellow "twitchers" flocked from Norfolk to Scotland to the Scilly Isles, in response to rumors of rare sightings, George&#x2014;with help from his lovely wife, Molly&#x2014;gradually discerned the true markings of a killer.

Born in Asia Minor in about 130 A.D., he became Bishop of Lyons and died as a martyr early in the third century. His main work, <i>Adversus Haereses (Against the Heresies)</i>, is as relevant today as it was eighteen hundred years ago. It is a critique of Gnosticism, the 'anti-body' heresy, which, far from dying out, continues to flourish as the main threat to the Christian faith in our own day. With serenity and good humor, Irenaeus unfolds the unity of God's purpose in creation and redemption, in Old and New Testaments. The flesh and blood which Gnosticism so despised has been assumed by God in the womb of the Virgin Mary, and glorified in the Resurrection and the Eucharist.</p><br><br><p>In this book, quotations from Saint Irenaeus have been arranged thematically in order to show the unity of his Christian view of the world. The texts have been selected and are introduced by the late Hans Urs von Balthasar, who is widely regarded as one of the greatest Catholic theologians of this century. They are translated by John Saward. "Everything in Irenaeus is bathed in a warm and radiant joy, a wise and majestic gentleness. His words of struggle are hard as iron and crystal clear, ... so penetrating that they cannot fail to enlighten the unbiased observer." <br><b>Hans Urs von Balthasar</b></p></p><p>Hans Urs von Balthasar (1905-88), a Swiss theologian and priest, is considered by many the most important Catholic theologian of the twentieth century. Incredibly prolific and diverse, he wrote over one hundred books and many hundreds of articles. A favorite theologian and spiritual writer of Pope Francis, as well as the two previous Popes, he was called the most cultured man of our time by Henri de Lubac, and Karl Rahner described his achievements as really breathtaking.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Latin, French, Armenian, Greek</p><h2>Happy: Why More or Less Everything Is Fine</h2><p>Everyone says they want to be happy. But that's much more easily said than done. What does being happy actually mean? And how do you even know when you feel it? Across the millennia, philosophers have thought long and hard about happiness. They have defined it in many different ways and come up with myriad strategies for living the good life. Drawing on this vast body of work, in <i>Happy</i> Derren Brown explores changing concepts of happiness&#x2014;from the surprisingly modern wisdom of the Stoics and Epicureans in classical times right up until today, when the self-help industry has attempted to claim happiness as its own. He shows how many of self-help&#x2019;s suggested routes to happiness and success&#x2014;such as positive thinking, self-belief and setting goals&#x2014;can be disastrous to follow and, indeed, actually cause anxiety. This brilliant, candid and deeply entertaining book exposes the flaws in these ways of thinking, and in return poses challenging but stimulating questions about how we choose to live and the way we think about death.<i> Happy</i> aims to reclaim happiness and to enable us to appreciate the good things in life, in all their transient glory. By taking control of the stories we tell ourselves, by remembering that "everything&#x2019;s fine" even when it might not feel that way, we can allow ourselves to flourish and to live more happily.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Derren Brown</b> began his UK television career in December 2000 with a series of specials called <i>Mind Control</i>. Since redefining the genre of magic for intelligent, modern audiences, he has become synonymous with the art of psychological manipulation. His TV shows have become must-see events. Amongst a varied and notorious career, Derren has played Russian Roulette on live television, convinced middle-managers to commit an armed robbery in the street, led the nation in a s�ance, stuck viewers to their sofas, successfully predicted the National Lottery, motivated a shy man to land a packed passenger plane at 30,000 feet, exposed psychic and faith-healing charlatans, and hypnotized a man to assassinate Stephen Fry. On top of this he tours the UK every year with a sell-out stage show. He has published four books: <i>Tricks of the Mind</i>, <i>Confessions of a Conjuror</i>, <i>Happy</i> and a book of his caricatures, <i>Portraits</i>.<br> &nbsp;"Brilliant.

In the last decade of his reign Edward III, a senile, pathetic symbol of England's past conquests, was condemned to see them overrun by the armies of his enemies. When he died, in 1377, he was succeeded by a vulnerable child, who was destined to grow into a neurotic and unstable adult presiding over a divided nation. Meanwhile France entered upon one of the most glittering periods of her medieval history, years of power and ceremony, astonishing artistic creativity and famous warriors making their reputations as far afield as Naples, Hungary and North Africa. Contemporaries in both countries believed that they were living through memorable times: times of great wickedness and great achievement, of collective mediocrity but intense personal heroism, of extremes of wealth and poverty, fortune and failure. At a distance of six centuries, as Jonathan Sumption skilfully and meticulously shows, it is possible to agree with all of these judgments.</p><p>Jonathan Sumption is a former History Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford. He is the author of <i>Pilgrimage</i> and <i>The Albigensian Crusade</i>, as well as the two previous volumes in his celebrated history of the Hundred Years War - <i>Trial by Battle</i> and <i>Trial by Fire</i>. He is also a practicing QC, well-known for his defence of the Government before the Hutton Inquiry, and other high-profile cases before the courts.<p>"There is no other book which tells the story of this phase of the war so fluently or in such absorbing detail, or which conveys so graphically 'the savagery, the utter savagery,' to say nothing of the sheer pointlessness, of it all. <i>Divided Houses</i> is a compelling, sustained exercise in original research: all in all, a remarkable achievement."&#x2014;<i>TLS</i></p><br><br><p>"Jonathan Sumption is not only one of Britain's leading lawyers but also an outstanding medieval historian, and in <i>Divided Houses</i> he has produced the third volume of his definitive history of the Hundred Years War, an enthralling account of English decay and French resurgence, which should be essential reading for Eurosceptics&#x2014;and saner people, too."&#x2014;David Cannadine, <i>TLS</i></p><br><br><p>"In <i>Divided Houses</i>, the third volume of his history of the Hundred years War, Jonathan Sumption marches on magisterially as the French and English (nothing 'British' about them) slog it out for the European heavyweight crown in one of the longest contests of all time."&#x2014;Frederic Raphael, <i>TLS</i></p><br><br><p>"This splendid history of the Hundred Years War belongs in any collection on late medieval western Europe.

To make things worse, he's very conscious of his aristocratic background and breeding. So it serves him right when he runs into Tabitha Devereaux. She's sassy, sexy, and completely unwilling to take him seriously. (Not to mention that she's the twin sister of the wife of former Dark-Hunter Kyrian-Val's mortal enemy.) What Tabitha does take seriously is hunting and killing vampires-and soon she and Val have to grapple with the deadliest of all Daimons-one who's managed to come back from the dead, and one who holds a serious grudge against both of them. To win against evil, Val will have to loosen up, learn to trust, and put everything on the line to protect a man he hates and a woman who drives him nuts.</p></p><p><p><b>"Without question, this is one of the genre's most fascinating, distinctive, and mesmerizing paranormal series."--<i>Romantic Times</i></b></p><p>Hail Glorious Reader: </p><p>I was born the noble son of a legendary Roman senator.

E. Cummings poem, beautifully illustrated by Mati Rose McDonough. Showing the strong bond of love between mother and child, within nature and throughout life, Cummings&#39; heartfelt words expressed through McDonough&#39;s lovely illustrations combine to create a fresh, yet classic, portrayal of love. First published by Liveright Publishing in 1952 in Complete Poems: 1904-1962 by E. E. Cummings, as [i carry your heart with me (i carry it in], &#34;I Carry Your Heart With Me&#34; has become a classic and very popular poem over the years. McDonough&#39;s illustrations provide a new artistic interpretation on this familiar poem.</p><p><b>E. E. Cummings</b> (1894&#x2013;1962) was among the most influential, widely read, and revered modernist poets. His many awards included an Academy of American Poets Fellowship, two Guggenheim Fellowships, and the Bollingen Prize. Among his many volumes are <i>The Enormous Room</i> and <i>Tulips &amp; Chimneys.</i> <b>Mati Rose McDonough</b> lives in San Francisco where she regularly encounters lucky elephants, talking birds, and a mysterious girl who always wears feathers in her hair. These creatures of mystery and grace remind her daily that no one is too old for magic or too young for beauty, so she paints their stories for fans of hope and adventure all over our dear world. McDonough studied painting at the California College of the Arts and has had many shows around the country. She has been featured in several magazines and books including <i>Artful Blogging</i> magazine and <i>The Handmade Marketplace.</i><br>In her first children's book, artist McDonough imagines the mother-child relationship as the centerpiece for the e.e. cummings love poem "[i carry your heart with me(i carry it in]," written using its original format and punctuation. In serene mixed-media collages, a mother with soulful eyes, rosy cheeks, and her hair in a short, black bob accompanies her daughter through the early stages of her young life, from infancy to her daughter's first excursion into the world on her own. Tucked within a cozy nest or seen flying overhead, a cut-paper mother bird and its offspring mimic the mother and child during their bonding moments, as do two whimsical paper elephants, scrawled in cursive ink and newsprint. Decorative hearts, leaves, water motifs, and assorted fabrics are also integrated throughout, complementing rather than overwhelming McDonough's rich, solid colors. The message of growth, nurturing, and boundless love will reach readers, while Cummings's emotional and succinct verse stands autonomously: "and it's you are whatever a moon has always meant/ and whatever a sun will always sing is you." Ages 2 6. (Apr.) - <i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>A mother shows her daughter the world, from season to season, from night into day, in the sweet, collage artwork that accompanies the poem [i carry your heart with me(i carry it in]&#x201d; by E.

This masterful merging of poetry and illustration makes for the perfect book for bedtime.

Originally in paperback.</p><p>David Weber is a science fiction phenomenon. His popular Honor Harrington space-opera adventures are &#34;New York Times&#34; bestsellers and can&#39;t come out fast enough for his devoted readers. Weber and his wife Sharon live in South Carolina.Here comes Honor Harrington again, and her entire crew of fans will man the yards to cheer. In her fifth adventure, she is trying to overcome self-doubts about her competence, grief over her lover's murder (despite having splendidly avenged it), and the barriers to a woman's being an effective feudal ruler on the fiercely patriarchal planet of Grayson. She is making headway when a Havenite fleet shows up, bent on the destruction of Grayson, and she must go back into space as an admiral while her enemies resort to open treachery and murder in trying to bring her down. Honor triumphs again, but with a believable amount of difficulty; she is growing into one of the more complex protagonists in military sf. Meanwhile, her fandom will continue to fall in love with Nimitz, the empathic treecat, and admire Weber's sheer ingenuity in so many aspects of creating Honor's universe. <i>Roland Green</i></p><h2>As America Has Done to Israel</h2><p>Is America on a collision course with God?<br> There is a direct correlation between the alarming number of massive disasters striking America and her leaders pressuring Israel to surrender her land for &#x201c;peace.&#x201d;<br> Costing hundreds of lives and causing hundreds of billions of dollars&#x2019; damage, dozens of disasters including devastating earthquakes, raging fires, hurricanes, floods, tsunamis, and violent tornadoes have hit America&#x2014;and always within twenty-four hours of putting pressure on Israel.<br> What can you do as an individual&#x2014;and what can America do&#x2014;to change the direction of our country in relation to Israel and prevent the increasing number of calamities?<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><p>God&#x2019;s everlasting promise to bless those who bless Israel and curse those who curse Israel is still in effect today.&nbsp; Throughout its history, America has been in a unique position to bless the Jewish people, and has experienced many blessings as a result.&nbsp; In more recent years, however, America has failed to consistently stand by Israel and suffered dramatic disasters.<br> <br> In this interesting and thorough book, McTernan traces the history of the Jewish people in America and how America&#x2019;s spectacular rise to power was tied to blessing the Jews.&nbsp; He examines America&#x2019;s integral role in fulfilling God&#x2019;s plan for the rebirth of the Jewish nation, and details the times when our nation defaulted on this call.&nbsp; Through a step&#x2013;by&#x2013;step analysis of political events, McTernan gives conclusive proof that God&#x2019;s judgment on those who curse Israel is still active.&nbsp; In every case where America has failed Israel, it has faced dramatic consequences within 24 hours.<b>John P.

But there was still little light under the three tall yews and the big oak; the night around him was still save for night birds, the whoo-whit of tawny owls and the screech of the barn type. Seven armed men lay grimly silent behind brush and waist-high grass, watching the great country house a quarter mile to the northeast. Candles and lantern lights flickered and blinked out behind the windows as the servants and garrison sought their beds. The pale limestone of it still glowed in the light of moon and stars.</p><p>When was that? Before the Change, of course, but when? In summer, I think.</p><p>Woburn Abbey was old; it began as a great Cistercian monastery, in the year when the first Plantagenet was crowned King of England. Henry VIII hung the last abbot from an oak tree on the monastery grounds when he broke with Rome and declared himself head of the Church, and granted the estate to a favorite of his named John Russell. The fortunes of the Russell family waxed and waned with those of the English aristocracy and England herself. In the palmy years of the eighteenth century the fifth duke rebuilt the country house in Palladian magnificence and surrounded it with a pleasance&#x2014;deer park and gardens covering five square miles&#x2014;very convenient with London only thirty miles to the south. In 1953 the eleventh duke had opened it to the paying public, complete with golf course, pub, guided tours and antique shop&#x2014;and avoided the forced sales which so many of his peers suffered after the Second World War.</p><p>Came on a day-trip, I did, drove up the M1. After I enlisted, but before I did the SAS selection...August of 1996, ten years ago to the month. Me first leave...who was the girl? Blond all over, she was, I remember that for certain. And she giggled.</p><p>In England the Change had struck in the early hours of the morning on March 18, 1998: the owner&#x2019;s family and Woburn&#x2019;s staff had only begun to realize what the failure of electricity and motors and explosives meant when the first spray of refugees from Milton Keynes and Luton arrived in the area two days later. The last duke&#x2019;s heir set up emergency quarters in the buildings and in tents in the great park, doing his best to organize supplies and sanitation. That ended when the last of the deer were eaten or escaped; by then most of the animals in the attached Safari Park had been released, before the keepers realized that even lion and timber wolves, tiger and rhino were edible when the other choice was death.</p><p>Shortly thereafter the hordes fleeing north from London met those from the midland cities moving south, and the great dying was well under way. A cannibal gang from the south side of Milton Keynes used the buildings as a headquarters for a time, roasting the meat of their catches in the fireplaces over blazes fed by the Regency furniture, rutting in the beds where Victoria and Albert had slept, and sitting beneath the Canalettos and Rembrandts to crack thighbones for the marrow with Venetian-glass paperweights. They turned on each other when prey grew scarce, and the last died of typhus on Christmas Day of 1998, shivering and comatose and alone.</p><p>Mary Sowley, that was her name. Bugger me blind if it wasn&#x2019;t ten years ago to the day . We drove through Safari Park and looked at the bloody lions and didn&#x2019;t that get her motor going...She married that commuter in Essex, the one with fuzzy dice hanging from his rearview mirror. God alone knows where the poor bitch left her bones. Hope it was quick.</p><p>Bicycle-borne scouts from the Isle of Wight scoured Bedfordshire in the spring of 1999; the smaller island off the south coast of the greater had kept two hundred thousand alive in the wreckage of a world, but resettling the British mainland was urgent. Their primary concern was to see where a useful crop of volunteer wheat could be reaped from fields unharvested the previous year and find the tools to do it, but on instructions from new-crowned King Charles III they made a stop at Woburn and a cursory attempt to board up windows and close doors as well, to protect the pictures and porcelain within. By the summer of Change Year Eight the estate was on the northeasternmost fringe of the recolonized zone, a royal garrison post in the commandery of Whipsnade.</p><p>There&#x2019;s some who&#x2019;d say it&#x2019;s stupid to think about girls just before the hitting starts. Sam Aylward had, for example; but then Samkin was the sort who polished bullet casings in his spare time to cut down on the chance of a jam. I wonder where old Sam ended up? He was abroad somewhere on the day of the Change.</p><p>It was now nearly a decade later, and even past midnight John Hordle was sweating beneath his chain-mail shirt and underpadding. Insects buzzed and burrowed and bit amid the mysterious rustles and clicks of any forest at night&#x2014;though these days that could include the movements of large carnivores with intent to harm.</p><p>Men are more dangerous, he thought whimsically. They&#x2019;ll go for your throat when they aren&#x2019;t hungry.</p><p>He could smell the intense yeasty smell of the dirt scuffed up beneath him as he crawled into position where grass and thistles stood tall. Training could let you move soundlessly; it didn&#x2019;t make you any lighter, and John Hordle had reached seven inches over six feet when he turned twenty in the year of the Change. He&#x2019;d never been fat, but the only time he&#x2019;d been under two hundred fifty pounds was that winter and spring, when the rations on the Isle of Wight had gotten just short of starvation amid hard labor and wet chill.</p><p>A soundless alert went among the men of his squad as boots tramped through the night, tense expectancy as a pair of sentries made their rounds between the raiding party and its target, tramping along the low ridge between the water and the house.</p><p>Vicious SIDs, he thought, motionless but acutely conscious of the speeding of the blood beating in his ears. Or Varangians, as Sir Nigel prefers. More dignified, I suppose.</p><p>The armor of the big men who paced by was enameled a dull matte green; they wore steel breast-and backplates, mail sleeves and leggings, and rounded sallet helmets with flares to protect the neck. That color didn&#x2019;t reflect much, but moonlight still glinted on steel&#x2014;the honed edges of broad ax blades. Those were long-hafted weapons meant to be swung two-handed; the trademark of their unit.</p><p>&#x201c;Hun er sviska!&#x201d; one said, murmuring and shaping the air with his free hand. Which meant, roughly: What a stunner!</p><p>Special Icelandic Detachment, right enough, Hordle thought.</p><p>He&#x2019;d picked up a little of the language&#x2014;mostly in bed and from girls&#x2014;since the islander refugee immigrants poured in during the second and third Change Years.</p><p>Same as King Charles, when he threw over Camilla and took up with Hallgerda. Mind, I don&#x2019;t blame him. Those legs!</p><p>The other guard chuckled and nodded: &#x201c;Hun heldur �fram og �fram.&#x201d; That translated as: She goes on and on!</p><p>His left hand closed slowly on the grip of his longbow; there was an arrow on the string and four more were laid out in front of him, points and fletchings blackened with soot. One of the SIDs flipped his ax down from his shoulder and began a casual practice routine with it, spinning it in his hands and switching from right-hand leading to left on the fly&#x2014;far from easy, and risky with an unshielded edge. It made an unpleasant fweeept sound as it cut the air in blurring arcs and circles.</p><p>Go on, Njal, Hordle thought, willing them to notice nothing. Back to your nice cozy room and take a nap...</p><p>The Woburn Abbey garrison was a thirty-man platoon of the Special Icelandic Detachment&#x2014;SID&#x2014;First Heavy Infantry Battalion, according to report. King Charles didn&#x2019;t want regulars guarding a prisoner who&#x2019;d been as popular with the troops as Sir Nigel Loring. That was why they&#x2019;d moved him here, as well, rather than keeping the baronet under house arrest on his own commandery of Tilford Manor in Hampshire; too many of the folk there had been men of his own, or refugees he&#x2019;d seen through the Dying Time on the Isle of Wight and led to settle their new lands. But Bedfordshire had only been colonized the last four years, and that, lightly; most of the dwellers were relocates from the Scottish islands and from Iceland and the Faeroes. They&#x2019;d spent years working for others before they could accumulate tools and seed and stock to set up on their own, and they&#x2019;d come this far north because the good land farther south was already claimed. And they were still much more likely to be unquestioning in their support of the royalist government than the native English.</p><p>Gratitude&#x2019;s a wonderful thing, Hordle thought sourly, as his chest moved in a slow, regular rhythm and his eyes flicked back and forth in a face darkened with burnt cork. Too bad Charlie didn&#x2019;t stay grateful to Sir Nigel for getting him out of Sandringham and down to Wight.</p><p>He&#x2019;d been with the SAS&#x2014;Special Air Service&#x2014;detachment Nigel Loring took to rescue the heir to the crown from the Norfolk estate a week after the Change; the Household Cavalry had taken the queen out of London directly, in full Tin Bellies fig and using their sabers more than once on the mobs.</p><p>Perhaps if she&#x2019;d lived Charles wouldn&#x2019;t have gotten so strange...Or if any of the politicians had made it... The last messenger out of London had said Blair was on his way, but he&#x2019;d never arrived.</p><p>If ifs and buts were candied nuts, everyone would have lived through the Change, Hordle thought.</p><p>A clank sounded from behind him. Ice rippled through the sweat on his skin; the sound had been faint, very faint, but it was worse than a snapped twig&#x2014;nothing else on earth sounded quite like metal on metal. The two SIDs stopped.</p><p>&#x201c;Who goes there?&#x201d; one of them called, his English accented but fluent. He reached for the horn slung at his belt. &#x201c;Show yourself! This is a prohibited zone!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, you conscientious keen-eared shite,&#x201d; Hordle sighed.</p><p>He drew the hundred-fifty-pound longbow&#x2019;s string to the ear with a slight grunt of effort as he rose to one knee; the SID he aimed for had just enough time to put his lips to the horn&#x2019;s mouthpiece before the arrow slashed through the intervening twenty feet. A sharp metallic tunk! sounded as the punch-shaped arrowhead struck the center of the guardsman&#x2019;s breastplate and sank nearly to the feathers, with the head and a red-dripping foot of shaft sticking out of his back.</p><p>The horn gave a strangled blat that sprayed a mist of blood into the air, looking black in the moonlight and turning his yellow beard dark. He toppled backward with a clank. Two more bows snapped in the same instant: one shaft went wide, but the other slammed into the second Icelander&#x2019;s nose. It had been shot uphill, from a kneeling position, and it angled upward through his brain and cracked out the rear of his skull, knocking the helmet off, spinning. The body shook in a moment&#x2019;s spastic reflex on the ground, rattling and rustling the armor as bootheels drummed on the turf.</p><p>Hordle was on his feet and moving before the helmet came to rest on the sheep-cropped grass. He ran crouching into the open, grabbed both bodies by their throats and dragged the two men and their gear back to the shelter of the brush at a quick, wary walk. There was blood on his left hand as he dropped them and sank down again beside his bow. He washed palm and fingers clean with water from his canteen, and reached under the hem of his mail shirt to wipe it off on the gambeson. It wouldn&#x2019;t do to have his hands sticky or slippery.</p><p>They waited silently, watching and listening. No sound of alarm came from the great Palladian manor ahead, a glimmer of pale limestone in the moonlit night. He nodded as Alleyne Loring came up beside him, going down on one knee. The young officer was twenty-eight, Hordle&#x2019;s age almost to a day. The pub that Hordle&#x2019;s father ran, the Pied Merlin, was less than half a mile from Tilford Manor, and they&#x2019;d grown up as neighbors and playmates before the Change and served together since.</p><p>Alleyne wore an officer&#x2019;s harness armored in plate cap-a-pie, from steel shoes to bevoir and visored sallet. He slid the visor up along the curved surface of the helm as he used his binoculars to scan the overgrown parkland between them and the entrance. It had been scattered trees and deer-grazed grassland before the Change, but even after the abbey was reoccupied there had been no labor to spare for ornamental work&#x2014;the garrison here lived from its own fields and herds, with a little help from nearby farmers.

But natural selection has given us a suite of beneficial social features, including our capacity for love, friendship, cooperation, and learning. Beneath all our inventions -- our tools, farms, machines, cities, nations -- we carry with us innate proclivities to make a good society. <br>In <i>Blueprint</i>, Nicholas A. Christakis introduces the compelling idea that our genes affect not only our bodies and behaviors, but also the ways in which we make societies, ones that are surprisingly similar worldwide. <br>With many vivid examples -- including diverse historical and contemporary cultures, communities formed in the wake of shipwrecks, commune dwellers seeking utopia, online groups thrown together by design or involving artificially intelligent bots, and even the tender and complex social arrangements of elephants and dolphins that so resemble our own -- Christakis shows that, despite a human history replete with violence, we cannot escape our social blueprint for goodness. <br>In a world of increasing political and economic polarization, it's tempting to ignore the positive role of our evolutionary past. But by exploring the ancient roots of goodness in civilization, <i>Blueprint </i>shows that our genes have shaped societies for our welfare and that, in a feedback loop stretching back many thousands of years, societies have shaped, and are still shaping, our genes today.</p><p><b>Nicholas A. Christakis</b> is a physician and sociologist who explores the ancient origins and modern implications of human nature. He directs the Human Nature Lab at Yale University, where he is the Sterling Professor of Social and Natural Science, in the Departments of Sociology, Medicine, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Statistics and Data Science, and Biomedical Engineering. He is the Co-Director of the Yale Institute for Network Science and the co-author of <i>Connected</i>.The diversity of our cultures and personal identities masks the fact that we are one. In this brilliant, beautiful, and sweeping book, Christakis shows how eight universal human tendencies have bound us together, and given us dominion over our planet, our lives, and our common fate. A masterful achievement that is surely the best and most original science book of the year. <b>-Daniel Gilbert, author of<i> Stumbling on Happiness</i></b><br><br>Nicholas Christakis is a pioneer in bridging the conceptual chasm between the choices of individual people and the shaping of an entire society. In this timely and fascinating book, he shows how the better angels of our nature, rooted in our evolutionary past, can bring forth an enlightened and compassionate civilization. <b>-Steven Pinker, author of <i>Enlightenment Now </i></b><br><br>In a book of great wisdom and unusual breadth, Christakis pulls together philosophy, history, anthropology, sociology, genetics, and evolutionary biology to make an extraordinarily optimistic argument: evolution has pre-wired us for goodness. At a moment when the dark history of the early twentieth century suddenly seems relevant again, it's a relief to be reminded of why so many efforts to re-engineer human society have failed -- and of why the better side of human nature often triumphs in the end. <b>-Anne Applebaum, author of the Pulitzer prize-winning <i>Gulag: A History</i></b><br><br>In this wisely optimistic book, Christakis explores the evolutionary imperative of forming bonds that are both cultural and genetic. His writing is colorful, personal, and often exuberant. <b>-Andrew Solomon, author of <i>Far from the Tree</i></b><br><br>Christakis brings to general readers his most famous theory: the genetic profile of both humans and animals dictates the types of societies that they create. Using a plethora of accessible examples that range from the social behavior of dolphins and chimpanzees to the tenets that link human behavior in a myriad of settings, from reality shows to arranged marriages, along with a generous look into the author's own past, Christakis reminds us that leadership, friendship, and group tendencies are all rooted in the most fundamental mechanism of our biological sorting: natural selection. A must-read for anyone interested in how we find ourselves wholly divided into political, religious, and workplace silos, and where these separations may lead us. <b>-Hope Jahren, author of <i>Lab Girl</i></b><br><br>A remarkable achievement! Christakis explains, in the most lucid and accessible way imaginable, how our genetic and cultural heritages are deeply intertwined. The story of human nature is no fairy tale, but it nevertheless reveals our potential, and our proclivity, for good. <b>-Angela Duckworth, author of <i>Grit</i></b><br><br>In this brilliant and humane book, Christakis defends an optimistic view of humanity. Human nature is not solitary and brutish -- we are social beings, capable of intimate ties and great kindness, blessed with extraordinary potential. <i>Blueprint</i> is clear, persuasive, and vitally important. <b>-Paul Bloom, author of <i>Against Empathy</i></b><br><br>Christakis has found that all human cultures converge on a consistent style of social network, and in <i>Blueprint</i> he explores the reasons why. The answer, he boldly argues, lies in our genes. Digging widely, Christakis shows that a gene-based account does not have to challenge the impact of culture, nor does it commit the analysis to reductionism or determinism. <i>Blueprint</i> stakes a powerful claim for a richer incorporation of biology into the social sciences. <b>-Richard Wrangham, author of<i> Catching Fire</i></b><br><br>With <i>Blueprint</i>, a thoughtful discourse on our genetic disposition toward community, Nicholas Christakis offers a compelling argument, replete with engaging stories, against the reductive notions of so many late-stage capitalists and libertarians. We are wired for a society, for cooperation, for engagement, for collective action. Darwin still applies: the survival of the fittest may mean the survival of those among us who can see beyond themselves and work with others doing the same. And therein lies some real cause for optimism. <b>-David Simon, writer and producer of <i>The Wire</i> and <i>The Deuce</i></b><br><br>In <i>Blueprint</i>, Christakis shows that goodness has a biological purpose. More than an ideal pushed upon us by moral and religious leaders, goodness is a survival tactic demanded by our very genes. Christakis's argument about our common humanity, made in such a powerful and vivid fashion, is an important one for these unstable times. He shows that kindness and love are not merely things we can do -- but things we must do. <b>-Brandon Stanton, founder of Humans of New York</b><br><br>Tribalism is all around us, but it does not have to be. After all, we are all human. In lively and engaging prose, Christakis shows what is possible, and what we must do. <b>-Eric Schmidt, former chairman of Google</b><br><br>Mixing brilliant insights with vivid and memorable storytelling, <i>Blueprint</i> is both deeply scholarly and, at the same time, a genuine pleasure read. <b>-Greg Lukianoff, author of <i>The Coddling of the American Mind</i></b><br><br>Come for the gripping stories about shipwrecks, communes, and Antarctic outposts. Stay for the sociology of networks. As social connectivity and the pace of change both increase in the 21st century, Christakis is the essential guide, and this is the essential book. A joy to read, and a warning about the challenges of creating new societies and institutions within which real human beings can flourish. <b>-Jonathan Haidt, coauthor of <i>The Coddling of the American Mind </i></b><br><br>A magnificent achievement. If you think you understand human nature, think again; Christakis will open your eyes and make you gasp. A special bonus: His book is inspiring and deeply optimistic. The perfect book for our time. <b>-Cass R. Sunstein, coauthor of <i>Nudge</i></b><br><br>As an historian, I probably tend to overemphasize the darker side of human nature -- our remarkable capacity as a species for generating war and revolution, manias, and panics. As a physician and a social scientist, Christakis is here to tell me to lighten up. 'There is more that unites us than divides us,' he argues in this deeply erudite and engaging book, 'and society is basically good.' If, like me, you respond to that claim with skepticism, you have a treat in store. Christakis will change your view of the naked ape. <b>-Niall Ferguson, author of <i>The Square and the Tower</i></b><br><br>We live in a time rife with 'us' versus 'them' divisions based on class, religion, ethnicity, and politics. But in this majestic, important, and enjoyable book, Christakis rightfully reminds us that we also evolved to live together, cooperate, and thrive in complex, diverse social groups. Now more than ever we need to understand and tap into these deep and fundamental adaptations that help us live and work side by side, value each other, and pursue common cause. <b>-Daniel E. Lieberman, author of <i>The Story of the Human Body</i></b><br><br>In the media and online, we live with a daily barrage of the things that divide us -- the differences among individuals, groups, and whole societies seem to define the ways we interact with one another. With a broad sweep of history and a deep knowledge of genetics and social science, Christakis takes us along a different path, one that is as important as it is timely. Whether in hunter-gatherer societies, small bands of people brought together by chance, or Silicon Valley corporations, our societies are linked by the common bonds of humanity. In <i>Blueprint</i>, Christakis shows how we are much more than divisiveness and division; we are programmed to build and thrive in societies based on cooperation, learning, and love. <b>-Neil Shubin, author of <i>Your Inner Fish</i></b><br><br>Christakis takes us on a spellbinding tour of how evolution brings people together, setting the stage for our modern world where online networks connect people in new and unprecedented ways. Our genes don't work in isolation; rather they equip our species with the capacity to join together and make great things. This powerful and fascinating book shows the fundamental good that lies within us, that connects us, and that helps us cooperate beyond the survival of the fittest. <b>-Marc Andreessen, co-founder and general partner of Andreessen Horowitz</b><br><br>In this provocative book, Christakis makes a thorough and compelling case that we are hardwired to value goodness in our societies -- and thus innately compelled to participate in building, strengthening, and enhancing the common good. In an era marked by polarization and rising inequality, Christakis marshals science and history into a message of hope. <b>-Joi Ito, director of the MIT Media Lab</b><br><br><i>Blueprint</i> is a brilliant and provocative tour de force that could not be more timely. I don't think I've learned this much from a book in a long time. Christakis is the rare author who can combine rigor and erudition with page-turning readability. Filled with fascinating studies, including experiments from his own lab, <i>Blueprint</i> ultimately offers reason for hope grounded in science for our difficult times. <b>-Amy Chua, author of <i>Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother</i></b><br><br>In an era when borders close and the perceived differences among us drive the public narrative, Christakis travels across societies and continents to remind us that we share much more than what keeps us apart. <i>Blueprint</i> unveils the communities and the social networks that define our successes and failures, and it celebrates the universality of human experience. A powerful and gripping book. <b>-Albert-L�szl� Barab�si, author of <i>The Formula</i></b><br><br>At a time when it seems that nothing can unite us, Christakis cuts through our divisions to reveal a rich and poignant look at our shared human nature. Christakis's trademark passion and broad scholarship are full-throttle as he lays out the ancient recipe for our shared humanity. Compelling, absorbing, and chock-full of delightful examples of what humans can do when they band together, <i>Blueprint</i> is a must-read. <b>-Coren Apicella, University of Pennsylvania</b><br><br>A blueprint for constructing a good society arrives when we most need it. Christakis has outrageous optimism, rooted firmly in biological and social science, that we will prevail. With a voice that is joyous and uplifting, he teaches us about the core of our nature -- this obligatory patterning of ourselves into units called society, with the building blocks being love, friendship, cooperation, and learning. What an enlightened house this blueprint will build if we, the occupants, heed his message about the possibilities that lie within us. <b>-Mahzarin R. Banaji, author of <i>Blindspot</i></b><br><br>One of the world's leading social scientists is on the hunt for the biological bounds of human culture, for what we are capable of as a species, and for society's generic tendencies. In this eloquent, wide-ranging book Christakis finds what turns out to be the good news about what it means to be human. <b>-Gary King, Harvard University</b><br><br><i>Blueprint</i> is a timely, powerful, and riveting demonstration of the inherent suite of sensibilities that drive our social life and cultural evolution. An authoritative integration of the social and evolutionary sciences, this engrossing work's great achievement is to definitively shift the focus of social inquiry from what differentiates us to our common humanity, and to show that, while we may be primed for conflict, we are also hard wired for love, friendship, and cooperation, inviting us, should we choose, toward a humane society. <b>-Orlando Patterson, author of <i>The Cultural Matrix</i></b><br><br><i>Blueprint</i> is highly original and engrossing. Christakis is a fluent and lucid writer with an arresting personal voice. At the heart of the book is what he describes as 'the social suite' -- a set of cultural universals that constitute the core and the blueprint of all societies. Integral to the universality of the social suite is his contention that these key features of all human societies are shaped by natural selection and encoded in our genes. Christakis calls into question a false dichotomy between cultural and genetic evolution. Rather, he regards the two as co-existing in ways that recurrently intersect and influence one another. He shows that the similarities that exist between the social attributes of human and animal societies bind humans together in a way that heightens our common humanity. <i>Blueprint</i> is a richly interdisciplinary, deeply documented, brilliant opus on how our long evolutionary history bends toward a good society. <b>-Ren�e C. Fox, University of Pennsylvania</b><br><br><i>Blueprint</i> is an exciting volume that constitutes a major scientific contribution of broad interest. It is a fascinating account of how genes and culture interact and how this knowledge provides the foundations for establishing a Good Society. <b>-Ernst Fehr, University of Zurich</b><br><br><i>Blueprint</i> is an extraordinarily readable and entertaining book that is also one of the most profound among recently published books on evolution. It brings to bear a long history of research to show that cooperation and pro-social traits of humans are genetically based and are the result of evolution by natural selection. By doing this, Christakis corrects one the most frequent misperceptions about biological evolution, namely that inter-individual competition is a law of nature. I only wish this book would have been published decades earlier. <b>-Gunter Wagner, Yale University</b><br><br>Nicholas Christakis zooms out, Yuval Noah Harari style, to look at how evolution shapes civilizations. Remarkably broad, deep, and provocative. <b>-Adam Grant, author of <i>Originals</i></b><br><br>As he explores human nature and its possibilities, the author touches on all sorts of fascinating anthropological matters, such as the evolution of monogamy and the relative friendliness of affluent vs. working-class people. A refreshingly optimistic view of our kind. <b>-Kirkus Reviews</b></p><h2>Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy: Lord and Peasant in the Making of the Modern World</h2><p>A landmark in comparative history and a challenge to scholars of all lands who are trying to learn how we arrived at where we are now.&nbsp;<i>-New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>BARRINGTON MOORE, JR is a Lecturer in Sociology at Harvard University and Senior Research Fellow for the University&#39;s Russian Centre.

Hollywood film star Fredric Stahl is on his way to Paris to make a movie. The Nazis know he&#x2019;s coming&#x2014;a secret bureau within the Reich has been waging political warfare against France, and for their purposes, Fredric Stahl is a perfect agent of influence. What they don&#x2019;t know is that Stahl, horrified by the Nazi war on Jews and intellectuals, has become part of an informal spy service run out of the American embassy. <i>Mission to Paris </i>is filled with heart-stopping tension, beautifully drawn scenes of romance, and extraordinarily alive characters: foreign assassins; a glamorous Russian actress-turned-spy; and the women in Stahl&#x2019;s life. At the center of the novel is the city of Paris&#x2014;its bistros, hotels grand and anonymous, and the Parisians, living every night as though it were their last. Alan Furst brings to life both a dark time in history and the passion of the human hearts that fought to survive it.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Praise for <i>Mission to Paris</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The most talented espionage novelist of our generation.&#x201d;&#x2014;Vince Flynn<br> &nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Vividly re-creates the excitement and growing gloom of the City of Light in 1938&#x2013;39 . . .

A Distinguished Faculty Fellow at Rice University, he divides his time between Houston, Texas, and Cape Code, Massachusetts.</em> <p>Fans of Alan Furst are a passionate lot, and I count myself among them. Put a group of Furst&#x2019;s readers in a room, and before long they will be ardently advocating for their favorites (I always come out swinging for <em>The World at Night</em>), only to change their minds, and change them again, as they are reminded of an especially harrowing episode in <em>The Polish Officer</em>, or a perfect turn of phrase in <em>Blood of Victory</em>, or a sumptuous love scene in <em>The Spies of Warsaw</em>.</p> <p>So which of Furst&#x2019;s novels is his best? In my opinion, it&#x2019;s an eleven-way tie.</p> <p>Now, make that twelve.</p> <p>Furst&#x2019;s elegant thrillers of World War II Europe are often grouped with the works Graham Greene and John le Carre for the literary quality of his prose. The comparison is apt, but Furst is really one of a kind: a novelist whose body of work has recast his genre, elevating it to the level of literature. He has a way of getting everything right, putting every sentence to flawless use with a compact, suggestive style. In just a few brush strokes, Furst can capture the essence of a character&#x2014;man or woman, friend or foe, Gestapo officer or society doyenne&#x2014;and his ability to evoke a setting makes me weep with envy. Furst&#x2019;s foggy Paris streets and glittering salons aren&#x2019;t just places we see; we actually seem to visit them, bathing in their rich atmospheres. When a Furst character steps into a caf� in the 16th Arrondissment, you can practically smell the Gauloises smoke wafting from the pages.</p> <p>But what truly sets Furst apart is his characters&#x2019; alignment with their circumstances. Like every great novelist, he understands that history is an overlay of private lives and public events, and therein lies the richest, most morally edifying human drama. Furst&#x2019;s protagonists aren&#x2019;t professional spies. Dashing, yes. Romantic, to be sure. Capable of the bon mot, without doubt. But in their hearts, they are men and women like the rest of us, adrift in the currents of their lives. It&#x2019;s the exigencies of war, with all its political murk and unlikely gunpoint bedfellows, that ignite them to personal heroism. You can hear them saying, with existential fatalism, &#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s been a marvelous life&#x2014;wonderful food, sumptuous parties, and surprising nights of love&#x2014;but I guess it&#x2019;s over now. I&#x2019;ll have to become something more. Count me in.&#x201d;</p> <p><em>Mission to Paris</em> is trademark Furst, a book not merely to read but to luxuriate in. Vienna-born Fredric Stahl, nee Franz Stalka, is a Hollywood actor of modest renown sent to Paris to star in a French movie named, ironically, &#x201c;Apres la Guerre&#x201d; (&#x201c;After the War&#x201d;). The year is 1938; Hitler has just taken Czechoslovakia and set his sights on Poland. With his American connections, high profile, and Germanic ancestry, Stahl attracts the interest of the political arm of the Reich&#x2019;s Foreign Ministry; their goal is to manipulate him into making a public declaration against French rearmament. Initially, all Stahl wants to do is enjoy his time in Paris, where fond memories and sensual adventures await, and finish his film, for which he has high hopes. But he can&#x2019;t stay on the sidelines for long; the next thing he knows, he&#x2019;s flying to Berlin to judge a film festival of nakedly propagandist &#x201c;mountain movies,&#x201d; with stacks of Swiss francs stuffed inside his suit to purchase Nazi secrets. The night he meets his contact&#x2014;the glamorous Russian actress Olga Orlova, who proves surprisingly adept with a silencer&#x2014;Stahl awakens to the smell of smoke and the sound of shattering glass: beyond the windows of his hotel room, <em>Kristallnacht</em> is in full swing.</p> <p>What happens then? Please. I&#x2019;ve said too much as it is.</p> <p>Suffice to say that for Furst&#x2019;s legion of the obsessed, the novel is everything we crave and more. And for newcomers&#x2014;why there should still be any, I simply don&#x2019;t know&#x2014;it&#x2019;s certain to send them back into his rich body of work, hungry for more.</p> <p></p><b>Alan Furst</b> is widely recognized as the master of the historical spy novel.

Views of this sort have dominated recent scholarly publication. The present volume, however, demonstrates empirically that this reductive materialism is not only incomplete but false. The authors systematically marshal evidence for a variety of psychological phenomena that are extremely difficult, and in some cases clearly impossible, to account for in conventional physicalist terms. Topics addressed include phenomena of extreme psychophysical influence, memory, psychological automatisms and secondary personality, near-death experiences and allied phenomena, genius-level creativity, and &#39;mystical&#39; states of consciousness both spontaneous and drug-induced. The authors further show that these rogue phenomena are more readily accommodated by an alternative &#39;transmission&#39; or &#39;filter&#39; theory of mind/brain relations advanced over a century ago by a largely forgotten genius, F. W. H. Myers, and developed further by his friend and colleague William James. This theory, moreover, ratifies the commonsense conception of human beings as causally effective conscious agents, and is fully compatible with leading-edge physics and neuroscience. The book should command the attention of all open-minded persons concerned with the still-unsolved mysteries of the mind.</p><p>Edward F.

Grieving his loss, Pliny the Younger inherited the Elder&#x2019;s notebooks&#x2015;filled with pearls of wisdom&#x2015;and his legacy. At its heart, <em>The Shadow of Vesuvius</em> is a literary biography of the younger man, who would grow up to become a lawyer, senator, poet, collector of villas, and chronicler of the Roman Empire from the dire days of terror under Emperor Domitian to the gentler times of Emperor Trajan. A biography that will appeal to lovers of Mary Beard books, it is also a moving narrative about the profound influence of a father figure on his adopted son. Interweaving the younger Pliny&#x2019;s Letters with extracts from the Elder&#x2019;s <em>Natural History</em>, Daisy Dunn paints a vivid, compellingly readable portrait of two of antiquity&#x2019;s greatest minds.</p> 8 illustrations</p><p><strong>Daisy Dunn</strong> is a classicist, art historian, and cultural critic. She is the author of <em>Catullus&#x2019; Bedspread: The Life of Rome&#x2019;s Most Erotic Poet</em> and <em>The Poems of Catullus: A New Translation</em>. She lives in Surrey, England.&#x201c;The Roman Empire comes to life through the biographies of two influential men.... [Dunn] creates a vivid tapestry of the Roman world.... A sensitive, spirited investigation of the ancient world.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus Reviews</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;[Sparks] impresses with her exceptional collection of wry, feminist stories.... Some stories smuggle incredible emotional impact into surprisingly few pages.... Sparks&#x2019;s sardonic wit never distracts from her polished dismantling of everyday and extraordinary abuses. Readers will love this remarkable, deliciously caustic collection.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Rather than provide us with merely a biography of a magistrate, Dunn gives us a portrait of an entire way of life.... Dunn also knows how to work a sentence. Without ever veering into historical fiction, she consistently succeeds in bringing what might otherwise seem dusty and remote to vivid life.... If there is much about Pliny&#x2019;s world that she makes seem familiar, then there is just as much that she makes seem very strange....The result is a portrait of the Roman Empire that gives the reader something of the shiver down the spine that Herculaneum can inspire: a sense that we are as close to the vanished world of two millennia ago as we are ever likely to get.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><i>Literary Review</i> (UK)</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Enthusiastic and vividly drawn.... An appreciation of both men, with frequent digressions on the Elder's opinions on oysters and metal scripture, the Younger's poetical ambitions and villas along Lake Como, and the effect of their dual legacy on future eras.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Kathleen McCallister, <i>Library Journal</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A delightful biography, interweaving extracts from [Pliny the] Elder&#x2019;s <em>Natural History</em> with [Pliny the] Younger&#x2019;s letters, speeches, and poetry into an insightful portrait of the men, their world, and their influence on people such as Giorgio Vasari, Frances Bacon, and Percy and Mary Shelley.... This is a rich, entertaining dual biography of two fascinating men, a revealing portrait of ancient Rome, and a celebration of nature that will appeal to fans of Mary Beard.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Merle Jacob, <i>Booklist</i> [starred review]</strong></p><h2>Schoolhouse Mystery (10) (The Boxcar Children Mysteries)</h2><p>Benny&#39;s curiosity, while staying in a fishing village, leads to capturing a swindler.</p><p>Gertrude Chandler Warner was born in 1890 in Putnam, Connecticut, where she taught school and wrote The Boxcar Children because she had often imagined how delightful it would be to live in a caboose or freight car.

She wrestles with the prophets&#39; rhetoric and sexual metaphors to uncover Israelite social structures, asking, &#34;What is implied about women, men, and God by the language that the prophets use to describe the covenant between Yahweh and Israel?&#34; This provocative work by a leading African American biblical scholar delves deeply into issues of intimacy and power, violence and control, seduction and betrayal, and is a searing indictment of the axial points of Israelite religion-its covenantal and prophetic traditions-and their authority today.</p><p>Renita J.

Epigenetics is an emerging field of science that studies alterations in gene expression caused by factors other than changes in the DNA sequence. Epigenetics: The Death of the Genetic Theory of Disease Transmission is the result of decades of research and its findings that could be as critical to our understanding of human health as Pasteur&#x2019;s research in bacteriology. Dr. Joel &#x201c;Doc&#x201d; Wallach has dedicated his life work to identifying connections between certain nutritional deficiencies and a range of maladies, formerly thought to be hereditary, including Cystic Fibrosis and Muscular Dystrophy. This nexus between nutrition and so-called genetic disease has been observed in both humans and primates, and it is the central theme of Epigenetics. To bring us Epigenetics, Wallach has teamed with noted scholars Dr. Ma Lan and Dr. Gerhard N. Schrauzer. Their collective expertise gives this book its far reaching perspective. Epigenetics is of vital importance to anyone who wants real knowledge about how the human body functions, and it provides a path for better health. Epigentics dispels the dogma and misinformation propagated by medical institutions and doctors resistant to change. Epigenetics is the beginning of a new era of well-being on this planet.</p><p><p>Dr Wallach was born and raised in Missouri , attended the University of Missouri, where he received a Bachelor's degree in Science of Agriculture. Dr. Wallach 's research has resulted in the publication of more than 70 peer review and refereed journal articles in the fields of nutrition and pharmaceutical research, and he has made major contributions to eight multi-authored text and reference books on these subjects.&nbsp;</p><p>Dr.Ma Lan was educated in the Peoples Republic of China. Dr. Ma Lan received her M.D. from Beijing Medical University, took her residency in Peoples Hospital, Beijing and was a staff surgeon at the Canton Air Force Hospitals for eight years; she received her M.S. (Master of Science) in transplant immunology from Zhong-Shan Medical University, Canton, Peoples Republic of China. As with all Chinese doctors, Dr. Ma Lan is also trained in Traditional Chinese Medicine.&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Schrauzer is Professor Emeritus (UCSD), researcher, inventor, and author. He is the Director of the San Diego-based Biological Trace Element Research Institute. Gerhard N. Schrauzer studied chemistry at the University of Munich, where he received Ph.D. degree with summa cum laude in 1956 and became a member of its Science Faculty in 1963. He came to the United States in 1964 and in 1966 accepted a position as Full Professor at the University of California, San Diego.</p></p><h2>Building Adolescent Literacy in Today&#39;s English Classrooms</h2><p><p><em>"Today's English classroom should not look like the English classes of the 1940s or even the 1980s.

Noticeably absent from these stories are the perspectives and experiences of the people who lived on the land long before European settlers arrived. Historian William Bauer seeks to correct that oversight through an innovative approach that tells California history strictly through Native perspectives. Using oral histories of Concow, Pomo, and Paiute workers, taken as part of a New Deal federal works project, Bauer reveals how Native peoples have experienced and interpreted the history of the land we now call California. Combining these oral histories with creation myths and other oral traditions, he demonstrates the importance of sacred landscapes and animals and other nonhuman actors to the formation of place and identity. He also examines tribal stories of ancestors who prophesied the coming of white settlers and uses their recollections of the California Indian Wars to push back against popular narratives that seek to downplay Native resistance. The result both challenges the &#34;California story&#34; and enriches it with new voices and important points of view, serving as a model for understanding Native historical perspectives in other regions.</p><p><p>Bauer tells California history strictly through Native perspectives.</p><b>William J.

This means creating a financial vision for your organization and planning how you&#x2019;ll get there. Financial Leadership for Nonprofit Executives gives you the framework, specific language, and processes to lead with confidence. With it, you&#x2019;ll learn how to protect and grow the assets of your organization and accomplish as much mission as possible with those resources. The good news is you don&#x2019;t have to be a trained accountant, earn an MBA, or have run a for-profit business in another lifetime. You already have many of the skills it takes to be a financial leader. This useful guide makes the process understandable and doable. You&#x2019;ll find clear, logical steps to learn how to get accurate financial data in a format you can understand; use financial data to evaluate your organization&#x2019;s health; plan around a set of meaningful financial goals; and communicate progress on these goals to your staff, board, and external stakeholders. You&#x2019;ll also find five foundational financial leadership principles; three overarching questions every financial leader needs to be able to answer (and where to find those answers); two fundamental budgeting principles; and five steps to building a strong annual budget. At the end of each chapter is an evaluation tool. You can rate how your organization is doing relative to the component of financial leadership covered in each chapter. Each attribute is scored as being red, yellow, or green. Red&#x201d; items are below standard and require immediate attention; yellow&#x201d; items are widely practiced though not generally ideal; and green&#x201d; items are considered best practice. Over time, as you and your partners on the board and staff move the organization toward green&#x201d; in each of these areas, you will create an environment in which financial leadership can flourish.</p><p>See our site for our complete listing, as well as free management tools, and information about our consulting services.JEANNE BELL PETERS is chief operating officer and a senior consultant at CompassPoint Nonprofit Services&#x2014;a leading provider of training, consulting, and research to the nonprofit sector with offices in San Francisco and San Jose, California.

Napoleon once said of himself. Born into a poor family, the callow young man was, by twenty-six, an army general. Seduced by an older woman, his marriage transformed him into a galvanizing military commander. The Pope crowned him as Emperor of the French when he was only thirty-five. Within a few years, he became the effective master of Europe, his power unparalleled in modern history. His downfall was no less dramatic.<br>The story of Napoleon has been written many times. In some versions, he is a military genius, in others a war-obsessed tyrant. Here, historian Adam Zamoyski cuts through the mythology and explains Napoleon against the background of the European Enlightenment, and what he was himself seeking to achieve. This most famous of men is also the most hidden of men, and Zamoyski dives deeper than any previous biographer to find him. Beautifully written, <i>Napoleon</i> brilliantly sets the man in his European context.<br></p><p><b>Adam Zamoyski</b> is the author of numerous books about Polish and European history, and has written for publications including the <i>Times</i> (London), the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>, and the <i>Guardian</i>.

It's even put together by Paul Dini, a major force behind the animated show. This particular story involves Batman's old foe, the Joker, and Joker's cute but deadly sidekick, Harley Quinn. Actor Mark Hamill of <i>Star Wars</i> fame, who plays the voice of the Joker in the animated series, claims that this is one of his all-time favorite comics, calling it "bold, lusty, gleefully demented."Paul Dini is a multiple Emmy and Eisner Award-winning writer and producer who has helped redefine the legends of the DC Universe in such series as <i>The New Batman/Superman Adventures</i>, <i>Batman Beyond, Krypto </i>and <i>Justice League Unlimited. </i>In comics he has authored THE WORLD'S GREATEST SUPER-HEROES, illustrated by Alex Ross.

She lives in the Southwest with her husband and cats, and spends most of her time in the wonderful worlds of her stories.<b>1</b><br><br> <i>London, March 1881</i><br><br> I had not been long at my post in Mount Street, Mayfair, when my employer's sister came to some calamity.<br><br> I must say I was not shocked that such a thing happened, because when a woman takes on the dress and bad habits of a man, she cannot be surprised at the disapprobation of others when she is found out. Lady Cynthia's difficulties, however, turned out to be only the beginning of a vast tangle and a long, dangerous business.<br><br> But I am ahead of myself. I am a cook, one of the finest in London if I do say it, and also one of the youngest to be made head cook in a lavish household. I worked some time in the winter at a house in Richmond, and it was a good position, but the family desired to sell up and move to the Lake District, and I was loath to leave the environs of London for my own rather private reasons.<br><br> Back went my name on the books, and the agency at last wrote to my new lodgings in Tottenham Court Road to say they had found a place that might suit. Taking their letter with me, I went along to the house of one Lord Rankin in Mount Street, descending from the omnibus at South Audley Street and walking the rest of the way.<br><br> I expected to speak to the housekeeper, but upon arrival, the butler, a tall, handsome specimen who rather preened himself, took me up the stairs to meet the lady of the house in her small study.<br><br> She was Lady Rankin, wife of the prodigiously wealthy baron who owned this abode. The baron's wealth came not from the fact that he was an aristocrat, the butler, Mr. Davis, had already confided in me-the estate had been nearly bankrupt when Lord Rankin had inherited it. Rather, Lord Rankin was a deft dabbler in the City and had earned money by wise investment long before the cousin who'd held the title had died, conveniently childless.<br><br> When I first beheld Lady Rankin, I was surprised she'd asked for me, because she seemed too frail to hold up her head, let alone conduct an interview with a new cook.<br><br> "Mrs. Holloway, ma'am," Mr. Davis said. He ushered me in, bowed, and withdrew.<br><br> The study in which I found myself was small and overtly feminine. The walls were covered in yellow moir�; the curtains at the windows were white lace. Framed mirrors and paintings of gardens and picturesque country lanes adorned the walls. A delicate, gilt-legged table from the last century reposed in the middle of the room, with an equally graceful chair behind it. A scroll-backed chaise covered with shawls sat near the desk.<br><br> Lady Rankin was in the act of rising from the chaise as we entered, as though she had grown weary waiting for me and retired to it. She moved listlessly to the chair behind her desk, sat upon it, and pulled a paper in front of her with a languid hand.<br><br> "Mrs. Holloway?" she asked.<br><br> Mr. Davis had just announced me, so there was no doubt who I was, but I nodded. Lady Rankin looked me over. I remained standing in the exact center of the carpet in my second-best frock, a brown wool jacket buttoned to my throat, and my second-best hat of light brown straw perching on my thick coil of dark hair.<br><br> Lady Rankin's garment was white, filmy, and high necked, its bodice lined with seed pearls. Her hair was pale gold, her cheeks thin and bloodless. She could hardly be thirty summers, but rather than being childlike, she was ethereal, as though a gust of wind could puff her away.<br><br> She glanced at whatever paper was in front of her-presumably a letter from my agency-and then over the desk at me. Her eyes were a very light blue and, in contrast to her angel-like appearance, were rather hard.<br><br> "You are very young," she observed. Her voice was light, as thin as her bones.<br><br> "I am nearly thirty," I answered stiffly.<br><br> When a person thought of a cook, they pictured an older woman who was either a shrew in the kitchen or kindhearted and a bit slow. The truth was that cooks came in all ages, shapes, and temperaments. I happened to be nine and twenty, plump and brown haired, and kind enough, I hoped, but I brooked no nonsense.<br><br> "I meant for a cook," Lady Rankin said. "Our last cook was nearly eighty. She is . . . gone. Living with her daughter." She added the last quickly, as though fearing I'd take gone to mean to heaven.<br><br> I had no idea how Lady Rankin wished me to answer this information, so I said, "I assure you, my lady, I have been quite well trained."<br><br> "Yes." Lady Rankin lifted the letter. The single page seemed too heavy for her, so she let it fall. "The agency sings your praises, as do your references. Well, you will find this an easy place. Charles-Lord Rankin-wishes his supper on the table when he arrives home from the City at eight. Davis will tell you his lordship's favorite dishes. There will be three at table this evening, Lord Rankin, myself, and my . . . sister."<br><br> Her thin lip curled the slightest bit as she pronounced this last. I thought nothing of it at the time and only gave her another nod.<br><br> Lady Rankin slumped back into her chair as though the speech had taken the last of her strength. She waved a limp hand at me. "Go on, then. Davis and Mrs. Bowen will explain things to you."<br><br> I curtsied politely and took my leave. I wondered if I shouldn't summon Lady Rankin's maid to assist her to bed but left the room before I did anything so presumptuous.<br> The kitchen below was to my liking. It was nowhere near as modern and large as the one I'd left in Richmond, but I found it comfortable and what I was used to.<br><br> This house was a double town house-that is, instead of having a staircase hall on one side and all the rooms on the other, it had rooms on both sides of a middle hall. Possibly two houses had been purchased and knocked into one at some time and the second staircase walled off for use by the staff.<br><br> Below stairs, we had a large servants' hall, which lay across a passage from the kitchen. In the servants' hall was a long table where the staff could take meals as well as a row of bells that would ring when someone above stairs pulled a cord to summon the servant he or she wished. Along the passage from the kitchen and servants' hall was a larder, and beyond that a laundry room, and then a room for folding clean linens, the housekeeper's parlor, and the butler's pantry, which included the wine cellar. Mr. Davis showed me over each, as proud as though he owned the house himself.<br><br> The kitchen was a wide, square room with windows that gave onto the street above. Two dressers full of dishes lined the white-painted walls, and a hanging rack of gleaming copper pans dangled above the stove. A thick-legged table squatted in the middle of the floor, one long enough on which to prepare several dishes at once, with space at the end for an assistant to sit and shell peas or do whatever I needed done.<br><br> The kitchen's range was neatly fitted into what had been a large fireplace, the stove high enough that I wouldn't have to stoop or kneel to cook. I'd had to kneel on hard stones at one house-where I hadn't stayed long-and it had taken some time for my knees and back to recover.<br><br> Here I could stand and use the hot plates that were able to accommodate five pots at once, with the fire below behind a thick metal door. The fire could be stoked without disturbing the ovens to either side of it-one oven had racks that could be moved so several things could be baked at the same time, and the other spacious oven could have air pumped though it to aid roasting.<br><br> I was pleased with the stove, which was quite new, likely requested by the wealthy lordship who liked his meal served precisely when he arrived home. I could bake bread in one oven while roasting a large joint of meat in the other, with all my pots going above. The greatest challenge to a cook is to have every dish ready and hot at the same time so none come to the table colder than any other. To aid this, a shelf above the stove that ran the length of it could keep finished food in warmth while the rest of the meal was completed.<br><br> Beyond the kitchen was a scullery with a door that led to the outside stairs, which ran up to the street. The sink was in the scullery so that dirty water and entrails from fish and fowl could be kept well away from the rest of my food. The larder, a long room lined with shelves and with a flagstone floor, looked well stocked, though I'd determine that for myself. From a cursory glance, I saw bags of flour, jars of barley and other grains, dried herbs hanging from the beams, spices in tinned copper jars with labels on them, and crates of vegetables and fruit pushed back against the coolest walls.<br><br> The kitchen itself was fairly dark, as most kitchens were, despite the high windows, so we would have to burn lamps all the time, but otherwise, I was satisfied.<br><br> The staff to run this lofty house in Mayfair wasn't as large as I'd expect, but they seemed a diligent lot. I had an assistant, a rather pretty girl of about seventeen who seemed genial enough-she reminded me of myself at that age. Whether her assistance would be useful remained to be seen. Four footmen appeared and disappeared from the servants' hall, as did half a dozen maids.<br><br> Mrs. Bowen, the housekeeper, was thin and birdlike, and I did not know her. This surprised me, because when you are in service in London, you come to know those in the great houses, or at least <i>of</i> them. However, I'd never heard of Mrs. Bowen, which either meant she'd not been in London long or hadn't long been a housekeeper.<br><br> I was disturbed a bit by her very thin figure, because I preferred to work with those who enjoyed eating. Mrs. Bowen looked as though she took no more than a biscuit every day, and then only a digestive. On the other hand, I'd known a spindly man who could eat an entire platter of pork and potatoes followed by a hearty dose of steak and kidney pie and never had to loosen his clothing.<br><br> Mr. Davis, whom I soon put down as a friendly old gossip, gave me a book with notes from the last cook on what the master preferred for his dinners. I was pleased to find the dishes uncomplicated but not so dull that any chophouse could have provided them. I could do well here.<br><br> I carefully unpacked my knives, including a brand-new, sharp carver, took my apron from my valise, and started right in.<br><br> The young assistant, a bit unhappy that I wanted her help immediately, was soon chatting freely with me while she measured out flour and butter for my brioche. She gave her name as Sinead.<br><br> She pronounced it <i>Shin-aide</i> and gave me a hopeful look. I thought it a beautiful name, conjuring mists over the green Irish land-a place I'd never been-but this was London, and a cook's kitchen was no place for an Irish nymph.<br><br> "It's quite lovely," I said as I cut butter into the flour. "But I'm sorry, my girl, we can't be having <i>Sinead</i>. People get wrong ideas. You must have a plain English name. What did the last cook call you?"<br><br> Sinead let out a sigh, her dreams of romance dashed. "Ellen," she said, resigned. I saw by her expression that she disliked the name immensely.<br><br> I studied her dark brown hair, blue eyes, and pale skin in some sympathy. Again, she reminded me of myself-poised on the edge of life and believing wonderful things would happen to her. Alas, I'd found out only too soon the bitter truth. Sinead's prettiness would likely bring her trouble, well I knew, and life was apt to dash her hopes again and again.<br><br> "Ellen," I repeated, trying to sound cheerful. "A nice, solid name, but not too dull. Now, then, Ellen, I'll need eggs. Large and whole, nothing cracked."<br><br> Sinead gave me a long-suffering curtsy and scuttled for the larder.<br><br> "She's got her head in the clouds," Mrs. Bowen said as she passed by the kitchen door. "Last cook took a strap to her." She sounded vastly disapproving of the last cook, which made me begin to warm to Mrs. Bowen.<br><br> "Is that why the cook was dismissed?" I already didn't think much of this elderly cook, free with a strap, whoever she was. Sinead's only crime, I could see so far, was having dreams.<br><br> "No." Mrs. Bowen's answer was short, clipped. She ducked away before she could tell me anything more interesting.<br><br> I continued with my bread. Brioche was a favorite of mine-a bread dough made rich with eggs and butter, subtly sweet. It was a fine accompaniment to any meal but also could be served as pudding in a pinch. A little cinnamon and stiff cream or a berry sauce poured over it was as grand as anything served in a posh hotel.<br><br> It was as I began beating the flour and eggs into the milk and sugar that I met Lady Rankin's sister. I heard a loud banging and scrabbling noise from the scullery, as though someone had fallen into it down the stairs. Pans clattered to the floor, and then a personage in a black suit burst through the scullery door into the kitchen, boot heels scraping on the flagstones, and collapsed onto a chair at the kitchen table.<br><br> I caught up my bowl of dough before it could be upset, looked at the intruder, and then looked again.<br><br> This person wore black trousers; a waistcoat of watered silk in a dark shade of green, with a shining watch fob dangling from its pocket; a smooth frock coat and loose cravat; a long and rather dusty greatcoat; a pair of thick leather gloves; and boots that poked muddy toes from under the trousers. The low-crowned hat that went with the ensemble had been tossed onto the table.<br><br> Above this male attire was the head and face of a woman, a rather pretty woman at that. She'd done her fair hair in a low bun at the base of her neck, slicking it straight back from a fine-boned face. The light color of her hair, her high cheekbones, and light blue, almost colorless eyes were so like Lady Rankin's, that for a moment, I stared, dumbfounded, believing I was seeing my mistress transformed. This lady was a bit older though, with the beginnings of lines about her eyes, and a manner far more robust than Lady Rankin's.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh Lord,&#x201d; the woman announced, throwing her bodyback in the chair and letting her arms dangle to the floor. &#x201c;I think I&#x2019;ve killed someone.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Bill of Rights (A True Book: American History) (A True Book (Relaunch))</h2><p><b>Learn how The Bill of Rights came to be.</b><br><br>A True Book: American History series allows readers to experience the earliest moments in American history and to discover how these moments helped shape the country that it is today.

What made me want to write this book, however, was not what I knew about President Garfield&#x2014;that he had been shot by a deranged man in the summer of 1881&#x2014;but all that I did not. <p>In everything I read, I am always looking for the thread of an idea, something that surprises me, and leaves me wanting to know more. To me, that&#x2019;s the best part of being a writer&#x2014;following an idea to see where it leads. Most of the time, after doing a little research, I quickly come to a dead end. One day four years ago, however, I found much more than I had ever expected.</p> <p>While reading a biography of Alexander Graham Bell, I learned that Bell had tried to help save Garfield&#x2019;s life after the President was shot. I wondered why a man as famous and powerful as Bell, who had invented the telephone just five years earlier, would abandon everything he was working on, put his life on hold, to help any man, even a President. The only way to answer that question, I realized, was to understand exactly what Bell had invented, and, more than that, to find out what kind of man Garfield had been.</p> <p>After the assassination attempt, Bell devoted himself night and day to inventing something called an induction balance, a type of metal detector, to locate the bullet lodged in the President&#x2019;s body. The induction balance that Bell used for the final time on Garfield is on display in the National Museum of American History, on the National Mall. What most people don&#x2019;t know, however, is that the museum also has all of the versions of Bell&#x2019;s induction balance, in various shapes and sizes, with hanging wires and unfinished edges, that he created while trying to perfect his invention. As I held these fragile instruments in my gloved hands, carefully examining their intricate workings, I could almost see Bell&#x2019;s mind working, and his heart racing, as the President drew closer and closer to death.</p> <p>Although, in the end, I would spend three years working on this book, it took only a few days of research to realize what Bell must have known&#x2014;that President Garfield was not only a tragic figure, but one of the most extraordinary men ever elected President of the United States. A passionate abolitionist, Garfield was not only hailed a hero in the Civil War, but was a fierce champion of the rights of freed slaves. At the same time, he was a supremely gifted scholar who had become a university president at just 26 years of age, and, while in Congress, wrote an original proof of the Pythagorean Theorem.</p> <p>With each diary entry and letter I read, each research trip I took, Garfield came more clearly and vividly to life. It was not until I visited the National Museum of Health and Medicine in Washington, D.C., however, that I began to understand the extent of the suffering that Garfield, and the nation with him, had endured. In its archives, in a large metal cabinet with long, deep drawers, the museum keeps the remains of two presidential assassins: John Wilkes Booth and Charles Guiteau, the man who shot Garfield. In the same cabinet, in a drawer just below Guiteau&#x2019;s, lies a six-inch section of Garfield&#x2019;s spine, a red pin inserted through a hole in the knobby, yellowed bone to show the path of Guiteau&#x2019;s bullet. It is impossible to look at this heartbreaking collection without being struck by the fact that this story, now hardly remembered, was once a tragedy so wrenching that it transfixed and terrified an entire nation.</p> <p>This book is my attempt to step back in time, to understand these men and this moment in history, and to tell a story that should never have been forgotten.</p> <p></p><p>Candice Millard, the "New York Times"-bestselling author of "The River of Doubt," is a former editor and contributing writer at "National Geographic" magazine.

He eagerly joins the band of men recruited by Brown to be Jayhawkers, Kansans who cross into neighboring Missouri to steal away slaves and help them to freedom. The Jayhawkers and their pro-slavery counterparts, the bushwhackers, clash often in bloody, sometimes murderous shootouts. In one such confrontation, Lije's father is killed, and Lije is recruited to live among a group of pro-slavery activitists as a spy. He learns about the quasi-soldiers led by Charles Quantrill, a cruel and unsavory character, and he meets Frank James and his brother Jesse. The story reaches its climax as Quantrill's forces attack and burn Lawrence, Kansas, where Lije's family lives. The unquestionable star of this story is Lije, a thoroughly believable boy caught up in events beyond his control but wanting to do his part for a cause in which he believes. The historical figures who populate the story are equally well portrayed; they appear as flesh-and-blood characters, not just names out of a history book. Another strength of this novel is that it tells a fast-paced suspenseful story while presenting a clear picture of a crucial period in U. S. history. The violence is not overplayed, nor is the abolitionist side portrayed as totally good. There is one glaring error in the text. Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 did not free all slaves in the United States, as the story says, but only those in states in rebellion against the Union. Other than this, the book is a solid piece of historical fiction that's sure to have strong appeal. --Bruce Anne Shook, Mendenhall Middle School, Greensboro, NC<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Billy Graham Christian Worker&#39;s Handbook</h2><p>The Billy Graham Christian Worker&#39;s Handbook Softcover book published by World Wide Publications, copyright 1984</p><p></p><h2>Why a Son Needs a Mom: 100 Reasons</h2><p>One son&#39;s loving relection on what his mother brought to his life as well as the aspirations she has been able to fulfill in part because of what he has brought to hers.

There had been tensions beforehand, rumors of disturbances in other towns whispered above my head, but no explosions, nothing outright. Caught between the mountains, Zagreb sweltered in the summer, and most people abandoned the city for the coast during the hottest months. For as long as I could remember my family had vacationed with my godparents in a fishing village down south. But the Serbs had blocked the roads to the sea, at least that&#x2019;s what everyone was saying, so for the first time in my life we spent the summer inland.<br><br>Everything in the city was clammy, doorknobs and train handrails slick with other people&#x2019;s sweat, the air heavy with the smell of yesterday&#x2019;s lunch. We took cold showers and walked around the flat in our underwear. Under the run of cool water I imagined my skin sizzling, steam rising from it. At night we lay atop our sheets, awaiting fitful sleep and fever dreams.<br><br>I turned ten in the last week of August, a celebration marked by a soggy cake and eclipsed by heat and disquiet. My parents invited their best friends&#x2014;my godparents, Petar and Marina&#x2014;over for dinner that weekend. The house where we usually stayed the summers belonged to Petar&#x2019;s grandfather. My mother&#x2019;s break from teaching allowed us three months of vacation&#x2014;my father taking a train, meeting us later&#x2014;and the five of us would live there together on the cliffs along the Adriatic. Now that we were landlocked, the weekend dinners had become an anxious charade of normalcy.<br><br>Before Petar and Marina arrived I argued with my mother about putting on clothes.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not an animal, Ana. You&#x2019;ll wear shorts to dinner or you&#x2019;ll get nothing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In Tiska I only wear my swimsuit bottoms anyway,&#x201d; I said, but my mother gave me a look and I got dressed.<br><br>That night the adults were engaging in their regular debate about exactly how long they&#x2019;d known each other. They had been friends since before they were my age, they liked to say, no matter how old I was, and after the better part of an hour and a bottle of FeraVino they&#x2019;d usually leave it at that. Petar and Marina had no children for me to play with, so I sat at the table holding my baby sister and listening to them vie for the farthest-reaching memory. Rahela was only eight months old and had never seen the coast, so I talked to her about the sea and our little boat, and she smiled when I made fish faces at her.<br><br>After we ate, Petar called me over and handed me a fistful of dinar. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s see if you can beat your record,&#x201d; he said. It was a game between us&#x2014;I would run to the store to buy his cigarettes and he would time me. If I beat my record he&#x2019;d let me keep a few dinar from the change. I stuffed the money in the pocket of my cutoffs and took off down the nine flights of stairs.<br><br>I was sure I was about to set a new record. I&#x2019;d perfected my route, knew when to hug the curves around buildings and avoid the bumps in the side streets. I passed the house with the big orange beware of dog sign (though no dog ever lived there that I could remember), jumped over a set of cement steps, and veered away from the dumpsters. Under a concrete archway that always smelled like piss, I held my breath and sped into the open city. I skirted the biggest pothole in front of the bar frequented by the daytime drinkers, slowing only slightly as I came upon the old man at his folding table hawking stolen chocolates. The newsstand kiosk&#x2019;s red awning shifted in a rare breeze, signaling me like a finish line flag.<br><br>I put my elbows on the counter to get the clerk&#x2019;s attention. Mr. Petrovi&#x107; knew me and knew what I wanted, but today his smile looked more like a smirk.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you want Serbian cigarettes or Croatian ones?&#x201d; The way he stressed the two nationalities sounded unnatural. I had heard people on the news talking about Serbs and Croats this way because of the fighting in the villages, but no one had ever said anything to me directly. And I didn&#x2019;t want to buy the wrong kind of cigarettes.<br><br>&#x201c;Can I have the ones I always get, please?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Serbian or Croatian?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You know. The gold wrapper?&#x201d; I tried to see around his bulk, pointing to the shelf behind him. But he just laughed and waved to another customer, who sneered at me.<br><br>&#x201c;Hey!&#x201d; I tried to get the clerk&#x2019;s attention back. He ignored me and made change for the next man in line. I&#x2019;d already lost the game, but I ran home as fast as I could anyway.<br><br>&#x201c;Mr. Petrovi&#x107; wanted me to pick Serbian or Croatian cigarettes,&#x201d; I told Petar. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know the answer and he wouldn&#x2019;t give me any. I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d;<br><br>My parents exchanged looks and Petar motioned for me to sit on his lap. He was tall&#x2014;taller than my father&#x2014;and flushed from the heat and wine. I climbed up on his wide thigh.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay,&#x201d; he said, patting his stomach. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m too full for cigarettes anyway.&#x201d; I pulled the money from my shorts and relinquished it. He pressed a few dinar coins into my palm.<br><br>&#x201c;But I didn&#x2019;t win.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But today that&#x2019;s not your fault.&#x201d;<br><br>That night my father came into the living room, where I slept, and sat down on the bench of the old upright piano. We&#x2019;d inherited the piano from an aunt of Petar&#x2019;s&#x2014;he and Marina didn&#x2019;t have space for it&#x2014;but we couldn&#x2019;t afford to have it tuned, and the first octave was so flat all the keys gave out the same tired tone. I heard my father pressing the foot pedals down in rhythm with the habitual nervous jiggle of his leg, but he didn&#x2019;t touch the keys. After a while he got up and came to sit on the armrest of the couch, where I lay. Soon we were going to buy a mattress.<br><br>&#x201c;Ana? You awake?&#x201d;<br><br>I tried to open my eyes, felt them flitting beneath the lids.<br><br>&#x201c;Awake,&#x201d; I managed.<br><br>&#x201c;Filter 160s. They&#x2019;re Croatian. So you know for next time.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Filter 160s,&#x201d; I said, committing it to memory.<br><br>My father kissed my forehead and said good night, but I felt him in the doorway moments later, his body blocking out the kitchen lamplight.<br><br>&#x201c;If I&#x2019;d been there,&#x201d; he whispered, but I wasn&#x2019;t sure he was talking to me so I stayed quiet and he didn&#x2019;t say anything else.<br><br>In the morning Milo&#x161;evi&#x107; was on TV giving a speech, and when I saw him, I laughed. He had big ears and a fat red face, jowls sagging like a dejected bulldog. His accent was nasal, nothing like the gentle, throaty voice of my father. Looking angry, he hammered his fist in rhythm with his speech. He was saying something about cleansing the land, repeating it over and over. I had no idea what he was talking about, but as he spoke and pounded he got redder and redder. So I laughed, and my mother poked her head around the corner to see what was so funny.<br><br>&#x201c;Turn that off.&#x201d; I felt my cheeks go hot, thinking she was mad at me for laughing at what must have been an important speech. But her face softened quickly. &#x201c;Go play,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Bet Luka&#x2019;s already beat you to the Trg.&#x201d;<br><br>My best friend, Luka, and I spent the summer biking around the town square and meeting our classmates for pickup football games. We were freckled and tan and perpetually grass-stained, and now that we were down to just a few weeks of freedom before the start of school we met even earlier and stayed out later, determined not to let any vacation go to waste. I found him along our regular bike route. We cycled side by side, Luka occasionally swinging his front tire into mine so that we&#x2019;d nearly crash. It was a favorite joke of his and he laughed the whole way, but I was still thinking about Petrovi&#x107;. In school we&#x2019;d been taught to ignore distinguishing ethnic factors, though it was easy enough to discern someone&#x2019;s ancestry by their last name. Instead we were trained to regurgitate pan-Slavic slogans: &#x201c;Bratstvo i Jedinstvo!&#x201d; Brotherhood and Unity. But now it seemed the differences between us might be important after all. Luka&#x2019;s family was originally from Bosnia, a mixed state, a confusing third category. Serbs wrote in Cyrillic and Croats in the Latin alphabet, but in Bosnia they used both, the spoken differences even more minute. I wondered if there was a special brand of Bosnian cigarettes, too, and whether Luka&#x2019;s father smoked those.<br><br>When we arrived in the Trg it was crowded and I could tell something was wrong. In light of this new Serb-Croat divide, everything&#x2014;including the statue of Ban Jela&#x10d;i&#x107;, sword drawn&#x2014;now seemed a clue to the tensions I hadn&#x2019;t seen coming. During World War II the ban&#x2019;s sword was aimed toward the Hungarians in a defensive gesture, but afterward the Communists had removed the statue in a neutralization of nationalistic symbols. Luka and I had watched when, after the last elections, men with ropes and heavy machinery returned Jela&#x10d;i&#x107; to his post. Now he was facing south, toward Belgrade.<br><br>The Trg had always been a popular meeting place, but today people were swarming around the base of the statue looking frantic, milling through a snarl of trucks and tractors parked right in the cobblestoned Trg, where, on normal days, cars weren&#x2019;t even allowed to drive. Baggage, shipping crates, and an assortment of free-floating housewares brimmed over the backs of flatbeds and were splayed across the square.<br><br>I thought of the gypsy camp my parents and I once passed while driving to visit my grandparents&#x2019; graves in &#x10c;akovec, caravans of wagons and trailers housing mysterious instruments and stolen children.<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;ll pour acid in your eyes,&#x201d; my mother warned when I wiggled in the pew while my father lit candles and prayed for his parents. &#x201c;Little blind beggars earn three times as much as ones who can see.&#x201d; I held her hand and was quiet for the rest of the day.<br><br>Luka and I dismounted our bikes and moved cautiously toward the mass of people and their belongings. But there were no bonfires or circus sideshows; there was no music&#x2014;these were not the migrant people I&#x2019;d seen on the outskirts of the northern villages.<br><br>The settlement was made almost entirely out of string. Ropes, twine, shoelaces, and strips of fabric of various thicknesses were strung from cars to tractors to piles of luggage in an elaborate tangle. The strings supported the sheets and blankets and bigger articles of clothing that served as makeshift tents. Luka and I stared alternately at each other and at the strangers, not knowing the words for what we were seeing, but understanding that it wasn&#x2019;t good.<br><br>Candles circled the perimeter of the encampment, melting next to boxes on which someone had written &#x201c;Contributions for the Refugees.&#x201d; Most people who passed added something to a box, some emptying their pockets.<br><br>&#x201c;Who are they?&#x201d; I whispered.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Luka said. &#x201c;Should we give them something?&#x201d;<br><br>I took Petar&#x2019;s dinar from my pocket and gave them to Luka, afraid to get too close myself. Luka had a few coins, too, and I held his bike while he put them in the box. As he leaned in I panicked, worrying that the city of string would swallow him up like the vines that come alive in horror movies. When he turned around I shoved his handlebars at him and he stumbled backward. As we rode away I felt my stomach twist into a knot I would only years later learn to call survivor&#x2019;s guilt.<br><br>My classmates and I often met for football matches on the east side of the park, where the grass had fewer lumps. I was the only girl who played football, but sometimes other girls would come down to the field to jump rope and gossip.<br><br>&#x201c;Why do you dress like a boy?&#x201d; a pigtailed girl asked me once.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s easier to play football in pants,&#x201d; I told her. The real reason was that they were my neighbor&#x2019;s clothes and we couldn&#x2019;t afford anything else.<br><br>We began collecting stories. They started out with strings of complex relationships&#x2014;my best friend&#x2019;s second cousin, my uncle&#x2019;s boss&#x2014;and whoever kicked the ball between improvised (and ever-negotiable) goal markers got to tell their story first. An unspoken contest of gore developed, honoring whoever could more creatively describe the blown-out brains of their distant acquaintances. Stjepan&#x2019;s cousins had seen a mine explode a kid&#x2019;s leg, little bits of skin clinging to grooves in the sidewalk for a week afterward. Tomislav had heard of a boy who was shot in the eye by a sniper in Zagora; his eyeball had turned to liquid like a runny egg right there in front of everyone.<br><br>At home my mother paced the kitchen talking on the phone to friends in other towns, then hung out the window, passing the news to the next apartment building over. I stood close while she discussed the mounting tensions on the banks of the Danube with the women on the other side of the clothesline, absorbing as much as I could before running off to find my friends. A citywide spy network, we passed on any information we overheard, relaying stories of victims whose links to us were becoming less and less remote.<br><br>On the first day of school, our teacher took attendance and found one of our classmates missing.<br><br>&#x201c;Anyone hear from Zlatko?&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe he went back to Serbia, where he belongs,&#x201d; said Mate, a boy I&#x2019;d always found obnoxious. A few people snickered and our teacher shushed them. Beside me, Stjepan raised his hand.<br><br>&#x201c;He moved,&#x201d; Stjepan said.<br><br>&#x201c;Moved?&#x201d; Our teacher flipped through some papers on her clipboard. &#x201c;Are you sure?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He lived in my building. Two nights ago I saw his family carrying big suitcases out to a truck. He said they had to leave before the air raids started. He said to tell everyone goodbye.&#x201d; The class erupted into high-strung chatter at this news:<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s an air raid?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who will be our goalie now?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good riddance to him!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Shut up, Mate,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;Enough!&#x201d; said our teacher. We quieted.<br><br>An air raid, she explained, was when planes flew over cities and tried to knock buildings down with bombs. She drew chalky maps denoting shelters, listed the necessities our families should bring underground with us: AM radio, water jug, flashlight, batteries for the flashlight. I didn&#x2019;t understand whose planes wanted what buildings to explode, or how to tell a regular plane from a bad one, though I was happy for the reprieve from regular lessons. But soon she began to swipe at the board, inciting an angry cloud of eraser dust. She let out a sigh as if she were impatient with air raids, brushing the settling chalk away from the pleats in her skirt. We moved on to long division, and were not offered a time for asking questions.</p><h2>The Science of Hitting</h2><p>Ted Williams is our greatest living expert on how to hit a baseball -- the last baseball player to hit .400 in the major leagues.

Through his storied tenure with the Red Sox, he pretty much got his wish. He not only hit, he <i>knew</i> how to hit; there was no keener, more devoted, more articulate student of the art. <i>The Science of Hitting</i> is his comprehensive book of wisdom and anecdote, a baseball bible that offers clear, concise, well-illustrated, fundamental information on how to hit a baseball and, just as important, how to <i>think</i> about hitting a baseball. Williams's first commandment is "Get a good pitch to hit," and, in one of baseball's most dramatic teaching tools--a photograph that divides his strike zone into 77 baseballs, seven wide by 11 high--Williams projects what he would hit at each pitch location, from .230 on the low-outside strike to .400 in what he called his "happy zone," the heart of the plate belt high. In 1941, that happy zone was obviously ecstatic; Williams hit .406 that year, the last to break the magic .400 barrier.<b>Ted Williams </b>won the American League batting championship six times and was given a place in the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1966.

Literally. &#x201c;Teenager,&#x201d; the word itself, doesn&#x2019;t pop into the lexicon much before 1941. This speaks volumes about the last few millennia. In all those many centuries, nobody thought to mention &#x201c;teenagers&#x201d; because there was nothing, apparently, to think of mentioning.&nbsp;In considering what I like to call &#x201c;the death of the grown-up,&#x201d; it&#x2019;s important to keep a fix on this fact: that for all but this most recent episode of human history, there were children and there were adults. Children in their teen years aspired to adulthood; significantly, they didn&#x2019;t aspire to adolescence. Certainly, adults didn&#x2019;t aspire to remain teenagers.&nbsp;That doesn&#x2019;t mean youth hasn&#x2019;t always been a source of adult interest: Just think in five hundred years what Shakespeare, Dickens, the Bront�s, Mark Twain, Booth Tarkington, Eugene O&#x2019;Neill, and Leonard Bernstein have done with teen material. But something has changed. Actually, a lot of things have changed. For one thing, turning thirteen, instead of bringing children closer to an adult world, now launches them into a teen universe. For another, due to the permanent hold our culture has placed on the maturation process, that&#x2019;s where they&#x2019;re likely to find most adults.&nbsp;This generational intersection yields plenty of statistics. More adults, ages eighteen to forty-nine, watch the Cartoon Network than watch CNN.2 Readers as old as twenty-five are buying &#x201c;young adult&#x201d; fiction written expressly for teens.3 The average video gamester was eighteen in 1990; now he&#x2019;s going on thirty.4 And no wonder: The National Academy of Sciences has, in 2002, redefined adolescence as the period extending from the onset of puberty, around twelve, to age thirty.5 The MacArthur Foundation has gone farther still, funding a major research project that argues that the &#x201c;transition to adulthood&#x201d; doesn&#x2019;t end until age thirty-four.6&nbsp;This long, drawn-out &#x201c;transition&#x201d; jibes perfectly with two British surveys showing that 27 percent of adult children striking out on their own return home to live at least once; and that 46 percent of adult couples regard their parents&#x2019; houses as their &#x201c;real&#x201d; homes.7 Over in Italy, nearly one in three thirty-somethings never leave that &#x201c;real&#x201d; home in the first place.8 Neither have 25 percent of American men, ages eighteen to thirty.9 Maybe this helps explain why about one-third of the fifty-six million Americans sitting down to watch SpongeBob SquarePants on Nickelodeon each month in 2002 were between the ages of eighteen and forty-nine.10 (Nickelodeon&#x2019;s core demographic group is between the ages of six and eleven.) These are grown-ups who haven&#x2019;t left childhood. Then again, why should they? As movie producer and former Universal marketing executive Kathy Jones put it, &#x201c;There isn&#x2019;t any clear demarcation of what&#x2019;s for parents and what&#x2019;s for kids. We like the same music, we dress similarly.&#x201d;11&nbsp;How did this happen? When did this happen? And why? More than a little cultural detective work is required to answer these questions. It&#x2019;s one thing to sift through the decades looking for clues; it&#x2019;s quite another to evaluate them from a distance that is more than merely temporal. We have changed. Our conceptions of life have changed. Just as we may read with a detached noncomprehension how man lived under the divine right of monarchs, for example, it may be that difficult to relate to a time when the adolescent wasn&#x2019;t king.&nbsp;About a hundred years ago, Booth Tarkington wrote Seventeen, probably the first novel about adolescence. Set in small-town America, the plot hinges on seventeen-year-old William Baxter&#x2019;s ability to borrow, on the sly, his father&#x2019;s dinner jacket, which the teenager wants to wear to impress the new girl in town. In other words, it&#x2019;s not a pierced tongue or a tattoo that wins the babe: it&#x2019;s a tuxedo. William dons the ceremonial guise of adulthood to stand out&#x2014;favorably&#x2014;from the other boys.&nbsp;That was then. These days, of course, father and son dress more or less alike, from message-emblazoned T-shirts to chunky athletic shoes, both equally at ease in the baggy rumple of eternal summer camp. In the mature male, these trappings of adolescence have become more than a matter of comfort or style; they reveal a state of mind, a reflection of a personality that hasn&#x2019;t fully developed, and doesn&#x2019;t want to&#x2014;or worse, doesn&#x2019;t know how.&nbsp;By now, the ubiquity of the mind-set provides cover, making it unremarkable, indeed, the norm. But there is something jarring in the everyday, ordinary sight of adults, full-grown men and women both, outfitted in crop tops and flip-flops, spandex and fanny packs, T-shirts, hip-huggers, sweatpants, and running shoes. And what&#x2019;s with the captain of industry (Bill Gates), the movie mogul (Steven Spielberg), the president (Bill Clinton), the financier (Warren Buffet), all being as likely to walk out the door in a baseball cap as the Beave? The leading man (Leonardo DiCaprio) even wears it backward. &#x201c;Though he will leave the hotel later with a baseball cap turned backwards . . . he is not so much the boy anmore,&#x201d; The Washington Post observes of the thirty-year-old actor. No, not so much.12&nbsp;If you&#x2019;ve grown up with&#x2014;or just grown with&#x2014;the perpetual adolescent, you see nothing amiss in these familiar images. It is the mature look of men from Joe DiMaggio to FDR&#x2014;the camel hair coats, the double-breasted suits, the fedoras&#x2014;that seems only slightly less fantastic to the modern eye than lace-collared Elizabethan dandies. The image of man, particularly as it has been made indelible on the movie screen, has changed from when Cary Grant starred in The Philadelphia Story, or William Powell starred in anything. In an essay called &#x201c;The Children Who Won&#x2019;t Grow Up,&#x201d; British sociology professor Frank Furedi sums up the difference.&nbsp;John Travolta nearly bust a gut being cute in Look Who&#x2019;s Talking, while Robin Williams demonstrated he was adorable as Peter Pan in Hook. Tom Hanks is always cute&#x2014;a child trapped in a man&#x2019;s body in Big, and then Forrest Gump, the child-man that personifies the new virtues of infantilism.13&nbsp;Such virtues require little effort besides dodging maturity. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not old enough to be a &#x2018;mister,&#x2019;&#x201d; goes the middle-aged refrain, a reflexive denial of the difference between old and young. This plaintive little protest is no throwaway line. Rather, it&#x2019;s a motto, even a prayer, that attests to our civilization&#x2019;s near-religious devotion to perpetual adolescence.&nbsp;Such devotion is quickly caricatured in the adulation of the craggy rock star, age sixty-three, still singing &#x201c;(I Can&#x2019;t Get No) Satisfaction.&#x201d; But the desiccated oldster cavorting like the restless youngster is hardly the end of the phenomenon. In a world where distinctions between child and adult have eroded, giving rise to a universal mode of behavior more infantile than mature, Old Micks are no more prevalent than Baby Britneys&#x2014;which is as good a name as any for the artless five-&nbsp; or six-year-olds taught to orgasmo-writhe (� la poppette du jour), belly bare and buttocks wrapped like sausages. At one time, so sexually charged a display by a child would have appalled the adults around her; now, Baby Britneys&#x2014;and they are legion&#x2014;delight their elders, winning from them praise, Halloween candy, even Girl Scout music badges.&nbsp;What caused the change? Even now, the Baby Boom figures into any explanation of our cultural mentality. But before the first Boomers came of age, a tectonic shift in sensibilities was already taking place that the multitudes of adolescents in the making would later magnify, accelerate, and institutionalize.&nbsp;To make a snapshot case, consider the respective images of two screen goddesses that took shape on either side of World War II: Jean Harlow, the archetypal platinum blonde of the 1930s, and Marilyn Monroe, the definitive 1950s sexpot. While both women&#x2019;s lives ended prematurely, Harlow from illness, Monroe from suicide, it is Monroe who lives on as the &#x201c;icon&#x201d; everlasting, the symbol of an industry to which her contributions are surprisingly limited. The salient point is this: Prewar Harlow, who began her career at age nineteen (and died at age twenty-six), never played anything but womanly roles. Prostitute, stage star, executive secretary, or social climber, she always projected an adult sensibility. Postwar Monroe, on the other hand, made a career out of exuding a breathy, helpless sexuality that, in spite of her mature age (she died at thirty-five), was consistently and relentlessly childlike. There&#x2019;s a reason movie audiences were willing to redirect their screen idolatry from the younger femme fatale (emphasis on &#x201c;femme&#x201d;) to the older sex kitten (emphasis on &#x201c;kitten&#x201d;). That is, the sequential popularity of such actresses reflects more than a simple variation on a theme of blonde loveliness. Rather, it reflects a changing paradigm of womanhood itself, a shift that signifies, to borrow a phrase from the late Senator Moynihan, the dumbing down of sexuality, a force at the crux of the infantilizing process&#x2014;and the sexual revolution to come.&nbsp;It came. Instead of sifting through the rubble of the old social structure&#x2014;blasted to bits, of course, as new sexual behaviors and attitudes volcanically emerged&#x2014;let&#x2019;s look at Baby Britney again. Some three decades after the sexual revolution, she rises from the ruins to symbolize the extent to which sexuality, particularly female sexuality, has been snatched from its traditional time and place in human development&#x2014;as a rite of passage to adulthood, to marriage, to having children&#x2014;and grafted onto girlhood, even toddlerhood, much to the regret of those among us who persist in costuming our wee ones on Halloween as cats, princesses, and cowgirls.&nbsp;Why the regret? Because not everyone has gone along with the new order. A sizable segment of the population still resists the pressure to transfer the milestones of maturity&#x2014;including, besides sexuality, a large chunk of financial and other freedoms&#x2014;to the very young. These are people who instinctively acknowledge differences between adults and children, and who harbor, maybe secretly, a nostalgic appreciation for the old-fashioned maturation process. Even as age has been eliminated from the aging process, they have a hunch that society has stamped out more than gray hair, smile lines, and cellulite. What has also disappeared is an appreciation for what goes along with maturity: forbearance and honor, patience and responsibility, perspective and wisdom, sobriety, decorum, and manners&#x2014;and the wisdom to know what is &#x201c;appropriate,&#x201d; and when.&nbsp;This is not to say that gray lives and blue noses offer the only anchors against the hedonistic currents of the times. There is a wide and complex range of experience&#x2014;emotional, aesthetic, physical, mental, and spiritual&#x2014;for which only the maturing human being is even eligible. Of this, of course, the immortal bards were well aware; today&#x2019;s artists are numb to it. Etched onto our consciousnesses, in the universal shorthand of Hollywood and Madison Avenue, is the notion that life is either wild or boring; cool or uncool; unzipped or straitlaced; at least secretly licentious or just plain dead. And framing these stark and paltry choices for us is the same kind of black-and-white sermonizing that once preached milk-and-honey visions of heaven and fire-and-brimstone visions of hell. Instead of eternal salvation, of course, we now seek instant fulfillment; instead of damnation, we do anything it takes to avoid the deep, dark rut of middle-class convention. Or so we claim.&nbsp;That&#x2019;s why, between the Very Beginning and Journey&#x2019;s End, an important aspect of Middle Age has gone missing&#x2014;the prime of &#x201c;making a life.&#x201d; The phrase is Lionel Trilling&#x2019;s, the esteemed critic and English professor, who, in the shank of the 1960s, saw that this work of making a life, &#x201c;once salient in Western culture,&#x201d; as he put it, was effectively over. This act of conceiving of human existence, one&#x2019;s own or another&#x2019;s, as if it were a work of art that could be judged by established criteria, he wrote, &#x201c;was what virtually all novels used to be about; how you were born, reared, and shaped, and then how you took over and managed for yourself as best you could. And cognate with the idea of making a life, a nicely proportioned one, with a beginning, a middle, and an end, was the idea of making a self, a good self.&#x201d;14&nbsp;We still, of course, have the beginning, but the middle only stretches on in a graceless vector that stops, one day, at an endpoint. Such a life is not, in Trilling&#x2019;s words, nicely proportioned, but it is, as he shrewdly thought, propelled by a new cultural taboo against admitting personal limitation&#x2014;one of the tribal beliefs that sets Baby Boomers apart from their parents. As Trilling could see, &#x201c;If you set yourself to shaping a self, a life, you limit yourself to that self and that life.&#x201d; And &#x201c;limitation,&#x201d; particularly to the perpetual adolescent, is bad.&nbsp;Copyright � 2007 by Diana West.

Known primarily for his work on the DC line of superheroes, Cooke always had an affinity for crime fiction and has often cited the Parker books as a great source of creative inspiration. Cooke has won multiple Eisner, Harvey, and Shuster awards, as well as the National Cartoonist Society&#x2019;s Best Series award. In 2008 Cooke was Emmy-nominated for the animated adaptation of his magnum opus, <i>DC:&nbsp;The New Frontier.</i>*Starred Review* Cooke garnered all sorts of acclaim (including the 2010 Eisner Award for Best Adaptation) for translating Donald Westlake&#x2019;s ruthless antihero Parker (the Parker novels were written under Westlakes pseudonym Richard Stark) into comics form with The Hunter, and here he returns with an even stronger follow-up. The crime syndicate that professional heister Parker so royally pissed off (they pissed him off first, to be fair) in the last book finds him languishing in Miami Beach with a surgically transformed face. The syndicates attempted hit goes wrong, and Parker shifts back into his relentless vengeance gear (he never smiles, but you get the sense he&#x2019;s happiest brawling and shooting his way through impossible odds) as he calls in a few favors from his underworld associates and goes after the head of the outfit. Cooke leans less heavily on large chunks of Stark&#x2019;s prose here than in the first book and flexes some serious cartooning muscle, from the stylishly visualized early-60s milieu to the sweet timing of the wordless action sequences to a virtuosic series of mini-heists, each drawn in a different style that highlights Cooke&#x2019;s considerable range, impeccable linework, and diligent grasp of graphic design. Even the deceptively simple coloring&#x2014;just a few shades of blue that slash grim crags beneath Parker&#x2019;s glaring eyes and swirl plumes of cigarette smoke in the dark&#x2014;exudes pure noir silkiness. It&#x2019;s a credit to both the source and Cooke&#x2019;s considerable skill, but straight-up crime fare (comics or not) doesn&#x2019;t get much more gratifying. --Ian Chipman</p><h2>House of Sand and Fog (Oprah&#39;s Book Club) (Vintage Contemporaries)</h2><p><b>NOW A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE<br></b><br>In this riveting novel of almost unbearable suspense, three fragile yet determined people become dangerously entangled in a relentlessly escalating crisis. Colonel Behrani, once a wealthy man in Iran, is now a struggling immigrant willing to bet everything he has to resotre his family's dignity. Kathy Nicolo is a troubled young woman whose house is all she has left, and who refuses to let her hard-won stability slip away from her. Sheriff Lester Burdon, a married man who finds himself falling in love with Kathy, becomes obsessed with helping her fight for justice.<br><br>Drawn by their competing desires to the same small house in the California hills and doomed by their tragic inability to understand one another, the three converge in an explosive collision course. Combining unadorned realism with profound empathy, <b>House of Sand and Fog </b>marks the arrival of a major new voice in American fiction.</p><p><b>Oprah Book Club� Selection, November 2000:</b> Andre Dubus III wastes no time in capturing the dark side of the immigrant experience in America at the end of the 20th century. <i>House of Sand and Fog</i> opens with a highway crew composed of several nationalities picking up litter on a hot California summer day. Massoud Amir Behrani, a former colonel in the Iranian military under the Shah, reflects on his job-search efforts since arriving in the U.S. four years before: "I have spent hundreds of dollars copying my credentials; I have worn my French suits and my Italian shoes to hand-deliver my qualifications; I have waited and then called back after the correct waiting time; but there is nothing." The father of two, Behrani has spent most of the money he brought with him from Iran on an apartment and furnishings that are too expensive, desperately trying to keep up appearances in order to enhance his daughter's chances of making a good marriage. Now the daughter is married, and on impulse he sinks his remaining funds into a house he buys at auction, thus unwittingly putting himself and his family on a trajectory to disaster. The house, it seems, once belonged to Kathy Nicolo, a self-destructive alcoholic who wants it back. What starts out as a legal tussle soon escalates into a personal confrontation--with dire results. <p> Dubus tells his tragic tale from the viewpoints of the two main adversaries, Behrani and Kathy. To both of them, the house represents something more than just a place to live. For the colonel, it is a foot in the door of the American dream; for Kathy, a reminder of a kinder, gentler past. In prose that is simple yet evocative, <i>House of Sand and Fog</i> builds to its inevitable denouement, one that is painfully dark but unfailingly honest. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p><i>House of Sand and Fog</i> has been named a finalist for the 1999 National Book Award in Fiction.</p><h2>Circle Maker</h2><p>Title: Be a Circle Maker( The Solution to 10 000 Problems) &lt;&gt;Binding: Paperback &lt;&gt;Author: MarkBatterson &lt;&gt;Publisher: Zondervan</p><p>Mark Batterson serves as the lead pastor of National Community Church in Washington, D.C.

They too were left stranded for two years after their ship was ripped from its moorings and swept away. Despite abandonment, the party made one of the longest continuous land journeys in the history of Antarctic exploration, sledging a record 1700 miles to lay the depots.

At a time when most other modernist authors adopted a rather dismissive tone toward popular culture and the emerging noise of industry, Joyce wrote <em>Ulysses</em> to extol the everyday man and embrace the bustle of middle-class streets. He wanted to infuse that commonplace Dublin world, in all of its grit and vulgar physicality, with a fierce passion and a miraculous interiority that would illuminate its underlying beauty.<br><br> For Kiberd, the seemingly banal hero of <em>Ulysses</em>, Leopold Bloom, embodies an intensely ordinary kind of wisdom and, in this way, offers us a model for living well, in the tradition of Homer, Dante, and the Bible&#x2015;all of which Joyce drew on in writing his book. By shedding light on Joyce&#x2019;s celebration of everyday life, Kiberd rescues <em>Ulysses</em> from the dusty shelves of rarified literary neglect and presents it to the audience it was originally written about and for which it was intended.</p><p>&#x201c;A feast. This book will reach and move many ordinary and extraordinary readers.&#x201d;&#x2015;Edna O&#x2019;Brien<br><br> &#x201c;The most exciting book I know on the most exciting novel ever written. Declan Kiberd&#x2019;s brilliantly informed and highly entertaining advocacy liberates Joyce&#x2019;s greatest book from the dungeon of unreadable masterpieces and restores it to being what its maker intended: a treasury of joys, a guide to enlightened living. <em>Ulysses</em>, finally, is a book about a friendship between a sometimes difficult young genius and a man made wise by life. No novel ever had a more understanding friend than Declan Kiberd.&#x201d;&#x2015;Joseph O&#x2019;Connor, author of <em>Redemption Falls</em> and <em>Star of the Sea</em>Declan Kiberd is a professor of Anglo-Irish literature at the University College Dublin and the author of Inventing Ireland: The Literature of the Modern Nation, which won the Irish Times Prize, and of Ulysses and Us: The Art of Everyday Life in Joyce&#39;s Masterpiece.

During their six-year partnership, the two became close friends. Feinstein blossomed under Gershwin&#x2019;s mentorship and Gershwin was reinvigorated by the younger man&#x2019;s zeal for his and his brother George&#x2019;s legacy. Now, in <i>The Gershwins and Me</i>, the only book of its kind, Michael Feinstein shares unforgettable stories and reminiscences from the music that defined American popular song, along with rare Gershwin memorabilia he&#x2019;s collected through the years.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From &#x201c;Strike Up the Band&#x201d; to &#x201c;Love Is Here to Stay,&#x201d; each of the twelve chapters highlights one of the Gershwins&#x2019; classic songs, exploring the brothers&#x2019; lives, illuminating what the music meant to them, and telling the stories of how their iconic tunes came to life. Throughout the star-studded narrative, Feinstein unfolds the moving chronicle of his own life with the Gershwins, describing his vision for their enduring presence today. No other writer could give us such an authoritative inside perspective on these titans of American culture&#x2014;and no other writer could include such a soulful collection of music as the accompanying CD packed with Feinstein&#x2019;s original recordings of the twelve songs.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A timeless classic and the definitive account of the Gershwins and their legacy, <i>The Gershwins and Me</i> will having you humming with every turn of the page.</p><p><b>Michael Feinstein </b>is an entertainer and educator known as one of the leading experts on classic American popular music.

Since then, it has been cited and debated by scholars and activists throughout the world as the most formidable defense of the tradition ever written. Now revamped, expanded, and vastly enhanced, <i>What Is Marriage? </i>stands poised to meet its moment as few books of this generation have. <br> <br> Rhodes Scholar Sherif Girgis, Heritage Foundation Fellow Ryan T. Anderson, and Princeton Professor Robert P. George offer a devastating critique of the idea that equality requires redefining marriage. They show why both sides must first answer the question of what marriage really <i>is</i>. They defend the principle that marriage, as a comprehensive union of mind and body ordered to family life, unites a man and a woman as husband and wife, and they document the social value of applying this principle in law.<br> <br> Most compellingly, they show that those who embrace same-sex civil marriage leave no firm ground--none--for not recognizing every relationship describable in polite English, including polyamorous sexual unions, and that enshrining their view would further erode the norms of marriage, and hence the common good.<br> <br> Finally, <i>What Is Marriage? </i>decisively answers common objections: that the historic view is rooted in bigotry, like laws forbidding interracial marriage; that it is callous to people's needs; that it can't show the harm of recognizing same-sex couplings, or the point of recognizing infertile ones; and that it treats a mere "social construct" as if it were natural, or an unreasoned religious view as if it were rational.<br> <br> If the marriage debate in America is decided soon, it will be with this book's help or despite its powerful arguments.</p><p><b>Sherif Girgis</b> is a Ph.D. student in philosophy at Princeton University and a J.D. candidate at Yale Law School.

One man has a healthy body and a happy family, an enriching complement of hobbies and a keen sense for Bob Dylan. By day he teaches high-school seniors to savor the rhythm and wit of Chaucer&#x2019;s poetry; by night friends help him savor red Bordeaux. A second man is debilitated, depressed, desensitized and detached. It doesn&#x2019;t take a poet or a saint to see who is better off.<br><br>It is equally clear that there is nothing special about Dylan, Chaucer, or Bordeaux that gives the first man his advantage. There is no <i>single</i> good life, but a range of good lives: countless ways of blending the basic ingredients of human thriving. But the ingredients themselves the most foundational ways in which we can thrive, what we call basic human goods&#x201d; are more limited. They include only those conditions or activities that make us better off in themselves, whether or not they bring us other goods. It makes sense for us to want these for their <i>own</i> sake. Health, knowledge, play and aesthetic delight are a few examples, and another is friendship.<br><br>Yet another basic human good, we think, is marriage. A critical point here is that marriage and ordinary friendship do not simply offer different degrees of the same type of human good, like two checks written in different amounts. Nor are they simply varieties of the same good, like the enjoyment of a Matisse and the enjoyment of a Van Gogh. Each is its own kind of good, a way of thriving that is different in kind from the other. Hence, while spouses should be friends, what it takes to be a good friend is not just the same as what it takes to be a good spouse.<br><br>What, then, is distinctive about marriage? All sorts of practices are grafted onto marriage by law and custom, but what kind of relationship <i>must any</i> two people have to enjoy the specific good of marriage? This framing of the question, though unusual, should not seem mysterious; we could ask it just as well of other basic human goods.<br></p><h2>Paradise Restored: A Biblical Theology of Dominion</h2><p>Paradise Restored: A Biblical Theology of Dominion by David Chilton.</p><p></p><h2>Walking: One Step At a Time</h2><p><b><b>A lyrical account of an activity that is essential for our sanity, equilibrium, and well-being, from the author of <i>Silence</i> ("A book to be handled and savored." &#x2014;<i>The&nbsp;Wall Street Journal</i>)</b></b><br><br>Placing one foot in front of the other, embarking on the journey of discovery, and experiencing the joy of exploration&#x2014;these activities are intrinsic to our nature. Our ancestors traveled long distances on foot, gaining new experiences and learning from them. But as universal as walking is, each of us will experience it differently. For Erling Kagge, it is the gateway to the questions that fascinate him&#x2014;Why do we walk? Where do we walk from? What is our destination?&#x2014;and in this book he invites us to investigate them along with him. <br><br>Language reflects the idea that life is one single walk; the word "journey" comes from the distance we travel in the course of a day. Walking for Kagge is a natural accompaniment to creativity: the occasion for the unspoken dialogue of thinking. Walking is also the antidote to the speed at which we conduct our lives, to our insistence on rushing, on doing everything in a precipitous manner&#x2014;walking is among the most radical things we can do.</p><p>Explorer, art collector, publisher, and author, <b>ERLING KAGGE</b> is the first person to have completed the Three Poles Challenge on foot&#x2014;the North Pole, the South Pole, and the summit of Mount Everest. He has written six books on exploration, philosophy, and art collecting, and runs Kagge Forlag, a publishing company based in Oslo, where he lives.One day, my grandmother was no longer able to walk.<br>&nbsp;<br>That was the day she died. Physically, she continued to live a little longer, but her new knees, which had surgically replaced the old ones, were worn out and no longer able to carry her body. The remaining strength in her muscles wasted away from the days spent lying in bed. Her digestive system began to fail. Her heartbeat slowed down and her pulse became uneven. Her lungs took in less and less oxygen. Towards the end, she was left gasping for air.<br>&nbsp;<br>In those days I had two daughters at home. The youngest, Solveig, was thirteen months old. As her great-grandmother slowly shrank into a fetal position, Solveig felt it was high time she learned how to walk. Arms raised above her head and hands clasped around my fingers, she managed to totter across the living-room floor. Each time she let go and attempted a few steps on her own, she would discover the difference between what&#x2019;s up and what&#x2019;s down, what&#x2019;s high and what&#x2019;s low. When she stumbled and smacked her forehead on the edge of the living-room table, she learned that some things are hard and others soft.<br>&nbsp;<br>*<br>&nbsp;<br>Learning to walk may be the most perilous undertaking of our lives.<br>&nbsp;<br>Arms outstretched to keep her balance, Solveig soon mastered the feat of walking across the living-room floor. Spurred by her fear of falling, she took short, staccato-like steps. Observing her first attempts, I was surprised at the way she spread her toes, as though trying to grab on to the floor. &#x201c;A child&#x2019;s foot doesn&#x2019;t know it&#x2019;s a foot yet,&#x201d; it wants to be a butterfly or an apple, writes the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda at the start of his poem &#x201c;To the Foot from Its Child.&#x201d;<br><br>All of a sudden, Solveig was moving with more confident steps. Through the open terrace door and out into the garden. Her naked feet now came into contact with something more than flooring: the Earth&#x2019;s surface&#x2014;grass, stone and, soon, tarmac.<br>&nbsp;<br>It was as though a small part of her personality&#x2014;her temperament, curiosity and will&#x2014;became more apparent when she walked. When I observe a child learning to walk, it feels as if the joy of exploration and mastery is the most powerful thing in the world. <br>&nbsp;<br>Placing one foot in front of the other, investigating and overcoming are intrinsic to our nature. Journeys of discovery are not something you start doing, but something you gradually stop doing.<br>&nbsp;<br>When my grandmother&#x2014;I called her my <i>mormor</i>&#x2014;was born in Lillehammer, ninety-three years before Solveig, her family still relied on their feet as the primary mode of transport from one location to another. Mormor could take the train if she wanted to travel very long distances, but she didn&#x2019;t have many reasons to leave Lillehammer. Instead, the world came to her. Throughout her youth she bore witness to the arrival of mass-produced cars, bicycles and aeroplanes in her region of Oppland. Mormor told me that my great-grandfather asked her to accompany him down to Mj�sa, the biggest lake in Norway, to watch an aeroplane together. She told the story with such rapture that it felt as if it had taken place the day before. The skies were&#x2014;suddenly&#x2014;no longer solely the realm of birds and angels.<br>&nbsp;<br>*<br>&nbsp;<br>I have no idea how many walks I&#x2019;ve been on.<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#x2019;ve been on short walks; I&#x2019;ve been on long walks. I&#x2019;ve walked <i>from </i>villages and <i>to </i>cities. I&#x2019;ve walked through the day and through the night, from lovers and to friends. I have walked in deep forests and over big mountains, across snow-covered plains and through urban jungles. I have walked bored and euphoric and I have tried to walk away from problems. I have walked in pain and in happiness. But no matter where and why, I have walked and walked. I have walked to the ends of the world&#x2014;literally.<br>&nbsp;<br>All my walks have been different, but looking back I see one common denominator: inner silence. Walking and silence belong together. Silence is as abstract as walking is concrete.<br><br>Before I got a family, I never wondered why walking was important. But the kids wanted answers: Why do we have to walk, when it&#x2019;s faster to drive? Even adults had questions: What is the point of moving <i>slowly </i>from one place to another?<br>&nbsp;<br>*<br><br>Until now, I have tried the obvious explanation, the one you turn to because it&#x2019;s quick and easy and the opposite of the essence of walking, which is slowness: I explain that he who walks lives longer. The memory sharpens. The blood pressure falls. Your immune system gets stronger. But each time I said it, I knew it was only half the truth. To walk is something much larger than a list of advantages you can read in an ad for vitamins. So what is the other half of this truth?<br><br>Why do we walk? Where do we walk from and what is our destination? We all have our own answers. Even if you and I walk next to each other, we can experience the walk differently. After having put my shoes on and let my thoughts wander, I am sure of one thing&#x2014;to put one foot in front of the other is one of the most important things we do.<br>&nbsp;<br>Let us walk.</p><h2>All Marketers are Liars: The Underground Classic That Explains How Marketing Really Works--and Why Authenticity Is the Best Marketing of All</h2><p><b>The indispensable classic on marketing by the bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>Tribes&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Purple Cow</i>.<br></b><br>Legendary business writer Seth Godin has three essential questions for every marketer:<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your story?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Will the people who need to hear this story believe it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is it true?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>All marketers tell stories.

We believe that $225 sneakers make our feet feel better&#x2014;and look cooler&#x2014;than a $25 brand. And believing it makes it true.<br><br>As Seth Godin has taught hundreds of thousands of marketers and students around the world, great marketers don&#x2019;t talk about features or even benefits. Instead, they tell a story&#x2014;a story we want to believe, whether it&#x2019;s factual or not. In a world where most people have an infinite number of choices and no time to make them, every organization is a marketer, and all marketing is about telling stories.<br><br>Marketers succeed when they tell us a story that fits our worldview, a story that we intuitively embrace and then share with our friends. Think of the Dyson vacuum cleaner, or Fiji water, or the iPod.<br><br>But beware: If your stories are inauthentic, you cross the line from fib to fraud. Marketers fail when they are selfish and scurrilous, when they abuse the tools of their trade and make the world worse. That&#x2019;s a lesson learned the hard way by telemarketers, cigarette companies, and sleazy politicians.<br><br>But for the rest of us, it&#x2019;s time to embrace the power of the story.

Journalist and marketing guru Godin, author of Purple Cow: Transform Your Business by Being Remarkable, contends that, in an age when consumers are motivated by irrational wants instead of objective needs and "there is almost no connection between what is actually there and what we believe," presenting stolid factual information about a product is a losing strategy. Instead, marketers should tell "great stories" about their products that pander to consumers' self-regard and worldview. Examples include expensive wine glasses that purport to improve the taste of wine, despite scientific proof to the contrary; Baby Einstein videotapes that are "useless for babies but...satisfy a real desire for their parents"; and organic marketing schemes, which amount to "telling ourselves a complex lie about food, the environment and the safety of our families." Because consumers prefer fantasy to the truth, the marketer's duty is to be "authentic" rather than honest, to "live the lie, fully and completely" so that "all the details line up"-that is, to make their falsehoods convincing rather than transparent. Troubled by the cynicism of his own argument, Godin draws a line at deceptions that actually kill people, like marketing infant formula in the Third World, and elaborates a murky distinction between "fibs" that "make the thing itself more effective or enjoyable" and "frauds" that are "solely for the selfish benefit of the marketer." To illustrate his preferred approach to marketing, the author relates a grab bag of case studies, heavy on emotionally compelling pitches and seamless subliminal impressions. Readers will likely find the book's practical advice as rudderless as its ethical principles. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

McKim has served as Academic Dean and Professor of Theology at Memphis Theological Seminary and as Professor of Theology at the University of Dubuque Theological Seminary in Iowa. He is the author or editor of over twenty-five books.Nearly 6,000 terms from disciplines such as the Bible, church history, ethics, ministry, spirituality, theology, and worship are defined here by McKim, a professor at Memphis Theological Seminary. He describes his work as not deep but broad in its coverage. Definitions are usually just two or three sentences long. He provides etymologies for many words, usually from Hebrew, Greek, or Latin. Many entries make reference to the Bible, noting book, chapter, and verse. Pronunciation would have been helpful for some words (e.g., <i>exegesis, hermeneutics</i>). Although published by the Presbyterian Church, this dictionary can be used by members of other Protestant denominations and Roman Catholics. McKim notes when a word is used only in a specific tradition or if faiths differ in their use of a term. For example, in <i>sacrament,</i> he notes that the Roman Catholic Church recognizes seven sacraments and Protestants, two. Definitions are accessible to lay Christians.<p>There are many specialized dictionaries of theological terms, such as the <i>Dictionary of Feminist Theologies</i> [<i>RBB</i> Ag 96] and the <i>Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics</i> (1986), but this new work will be especially useful in academic and public libraries that need a general dictionary with broad coverage. <i>Sandy Whiteley</i></p></p><h2>The Secret of the Sealed Room</h2><p>A mystery of young Benjamin Franklin.</p><p></p><h2>Simple Dreams: A Musical Memoir</h2><p><b>In this memoir, iconic singer Linda Ronstadt weaves together a captivating story of her origins in Tucson, Arizona, and her rise to stardom in the Southern California music scene of the 1960s and &#x2019;70s.</b><br><br>Tracing the timeline of her remarkable life, Linda Ronstadt, whose forty-five year career has encompassed a wide array of musical styles, weaves together a captivating story of her origins in Tucson, Arizona, and her rise to stardom in the Southern California music scene of the 1960s and &#x2019;70s.<br> <br> Linda Ronstadt was born into a musical family, and her childhood was filled with everything from Gilbert and Sullivan to Mexican folk music to jazz and opera. Her artistic curiosity blossomed early, and she and her siblings began performing their own music for anyone who would listen. Now, in this beautifully crafted memoir, Ronstadt tells the story of her wide-ranging and utterly unique musical journey. <br> <br>Ronstadt arrived in Los Angeles just as the folkrock movement was beginning to bloom, setting the stage for the development of country-rock. As part of the coterie of like-minded artists who played at the famed Troubadour club in West Hollywood, she helped define the musical style that dominated American music in the 1970s. One of her early backup bands went on to become the Eagles, and Linda went on to become the most successful female artist of the decade. <br> <br>In <i>Simple Dreams</i>, Ronstadt reveals the eclectic and fascinating journey that led to her long-lasting success, including stories behind many of her beloved songs. And she describes it all in a voice as beautiful as the one that sang &#x201c;Heart Like a Wheel&#x201d;&#x2014;longing, graceful, and authentic.</p><p>Linda Ronstadt has received twelve Grammy Awards, two Academy of Country Music Awards, and one Emmy Award, as well as several Tony and Golden Globe nominations.

She was hungry, and maybe wanted to fortify herself against the brutally hard work of pushing out a baby, a task that lay immediately and ominously before her. It was raining hard, and the streets were badly flooded. My father, a prudent man, wanted to be sure I was born in the hospital and not in his car. He loved my mother tenderly and was unlikely to deny her anything within reason, but he denied her this, and so I was delivered safely from the watery world of her interior to the watery exterior world of the Arizona desert in a cloudburst.<br> <br>In the desert, rain is always a cause for jubilation. July and August brought the ferocious seasonal rainstorms on which all life, including mine, depended.<br> <br>I was brought home to a house my parents had built of adobe on the last ten acres of my grandfather Fred Ronstadt&#x2019;s cattle ranch. He had sold it off in parcels during the dunning years of the Depression and relied on the thriving hardware business he had built in downtown Tucson at the end of the nineteenth century to supply a living for my grandmother and their four sons. It bore his name proudly as the F. Ronstadt Hardware Company and took up nearly a city block. I remember it as a wonderful place of heavily timbered floors and the pervasive smell of diesel oil. Inside it were tractors, bulldozers, pumps, windmills, bins of nails, camping supplies, high quality tools, and housewares.<br> <br>My grandfather, having been born in Sonora, Mexico, did business with all the Mexican ranchers who were within a three or four days&#x2019; drive by car, a journey often made by my father. In those days, the border was a friendly place, and easy to cross. We knew many of the families in the north of Mexico, and we attended one another&#x2019;s balls, picnics, weddings, and baptisms. My parents often drove us across the border into Nogales, which had wonderful stores where we would shop. After that, they would take us to the cool, plush recesses of the Cavern Caf�, and we would be served a delicious turtle soup.<br> <br>I deeply miss those times when the border was a permeable line and the two cultures mixed in a natural and agreeable fashion. Lately, the border seems more like the Berlin Wall, and functions mainly to separate families and interfere with wildlife migration.<br> <br>My father, in addition to working in the hardware store and going to the University of Arizona in Tucson, helped my grandfather on the ranches he owned.<br> <br>My mother, who was called Ruth Mary, told us that the first time she saw my father, he was riding his horse up the stairs of her sorority house. He was pursuing someone who was not my mother, but his eye was soon drawn to her.<br> <br>In 1934 she&#x2019;d made the three-day journey by train from her home state of Michigan to the University of Arizona, where she was enrolled to study math and physics. She was passionate about math. When she was worried or couldn&#x2019;t sleep, we would find her at three o&#x2019;clock in the morning, sitting at the dining room table, working a problem in calculus.<br> <br>Her father was Lloyd G. Copeman, a well-known inventor, with the electric toaster, electric stove, rubber ice cube tray, and pneumatic grease gun to his credit. He also operated an experimental dairy farm in the Michigan countryside and, early in the twentieth century, invented a milking machine. He used to demonstrate one of his inventions, a 1918 version of the microwave oven that he called &#x201c;cold heat,&#x201d; by frying an egg through a newspaper. Thinking that the oven was too expensive to manufacture, he never patented it. He worked closely with Charles Stewart Mott, then chairman of the board of General Motors, and developed a great deal of what was then state-of-the-art equipment in the Buick factory in Flint, Michigan.<br> <br>Old Mr. Mott was fond of my mother and came many times to visit us in the wilds of Tucson. In the fifties, he was caricatured with his enormously bushy white eyebrows as General Bullmoose in Li&#x2019;l Abner, a long-running comic strip drawn by Al Capp. We read it regularly in the Tucson Daily Citizen.<br> <br>Coming from such a background, my mother must have found my father, and the Arizona desert that had shaped him, to be richly exotic.<br> <br>My father, known as Gilbert, was handsome and somewhat shy. He rarely spoke unless he had something worthy to say. When he did speak, his words carried a quiet authority. He had a beautiful baritone singing voice that sounded like a cross between Pedro Infante, the famous Mexican matinee idol and singer, and Frank Sinatra. He often sang at local venues like the Fox Tucson Theatre, where he was billed as Gil Ronstadt and his Star-Spangled Megaphone. He serenaded my mother under her window with pretty Mexican songs such as &#x201c;La Barca de Oro&#x201d; and &#x201c;Qui�reme Mucho.&#x201d; Added to this was the fact that when my mother was introduced to my grandfather, an autodidact, he dazzled her with his knowledge of geometry and calculus. My mother surely thought she was marrying into a gene pool that would produce mathematicians, but my grandfather was also a musician, so musicians were what she got.<br> <br>In the late nineteenth century, my grandfather was the conductor of a brass band called the Club Filarm�nico Tucsonense. He taught people how to play their instruments, conducted the band, composed and arranged, and played the flute. I have the cornet part written in his own hand from an instrumental arrangement he wrote for The Pirates of Penzance in 1896.<br> <br>He was a widower when he married my grandmother. A daughter from his first marriage, Luisa Espinel, was a singer, dancer, and music scholar who collected and performed traditional songs and dances from northern Mexico and many regions in Spain. She can be seen in a brief comedic appearance as a Spanish dancer in The Devil Is a Woman, a 1935 film that starred Marlene Dietrich.<br> <br>In the twenties, she wrote a letter home to my grandfather from Spain, where she had been performing. In it she reported that she was hugely excited about a guitarist she had hired to be her accompanist. She said he was such a brilliant player that he could hold the audience when she left the stage to change costumes. She wanted to bring him to the United States because she was sure he would make a huge hit with American audiences and eventually establish his own career. His name was Andr�s Segovia.<br> <br>When we were small children, visits from Aunt Luisa were wonderfully exciting. She taught my sister how to do the shimmy and how to play the castanets, and allowed her to try on the beautiful regional Spanish costumes that she had worn as a dancer.<br> <br>She had lived many years in Spain and been married to a painter who was a Communist and had supported the cause to establish a republic in the Spanish Civil War. My aunt had been friends with the poet Federico Garc�a Lorca, who used to play her guitar while he recited his beautiful poems. We found her deliriously glamorous. Many years later, I would take the title of a collection of Mexican folk songs and stories she published called Canciones de Mi Padre, and use it to title my own first recording of traditional Mexican songs.<br> <br>My mother and father married in 1937. Between that time and the beginning of World War II, they produced my sister, Suzy, and my brother Peter.<br> <br>When the war started and my father joined the army, our mother went to work at night in the control tower of Davis-Monthan Army Air Field, the base outside of Tucson. Toward the end of the war, the planes that flew out of there on their way to war were mostly brand-new Boeing B-29 Superfortresses. After the war was over, all but a few of the B-29s that could still fly came back to Davis-Monthan, part of which became a graveyard for the decommissioned planes of World War II. Their flight path took them directly over our house. My mother would catch the sound of their engines and run outside and wave at them frantically. We kids would wave too. She had launched them into battle from her control tower, and she must have felt some obligation and no small amount of emotion to welcome home the ones that made it back alive.<br> <br>I was steeped in the sound of the B-29s in my childhood and often tried to emulate it in the string arrangements in my recordings. It seems to appear in the grind between the cello and double bass, particularly in the interval of a fifth.<br> <br>In the treacherous currents of the Great Depression and World War II, my grandfather nearly lost his hardware business. His unwillingness to foreclose on the farmers and ranchers who were struggling in the same way didn&#x2019;t help his bottom line, but he was loved and respected throughout the valley and beyond to Mexico as a good man who kept his word.<br> <br>During the Depression, my father turned down an offer from Paul Whiteman, by far the most popular bandleader of his time, to tour with them as their &#x201c;boy singer.&#x201d; Over the years, other singers with the Whiteman Orchestra included Bing Crosby, Mildred Bailey, and Billie Holiday. I believe it was a decision that caused him some disappointment, but family loyalties prevailed. He and his brothers helped my grandfather with the ranch and the hardware store, finally selling off the ranch and plowing the money back into the store. They managed to survive the Depression and build the business.<br> <br>There was never any extra cash, but we had what we needed. My mother used to joke that when she first met my father, he had a red convertible, a horse, a ranch, and a guitar. After she married him, all he had left was the guitar. He had my mother too. They rarely quarreled, and when they did, it was well out of earshot of their children. They were always on each other&#x2019;s side, and their marriage lasted until my mother died in 1982.<br> <br><br> <br>Newcomers to the desert are shocked when I suggest to them that the most dangerous thing in it is not the poisonous Gila monster or the sidewinder rattlesnake that also makes its home there. It is water. Water is not quick to be absorbed into the hard-packed desert floor. Instead, it runs all over the surface of the ground and reflects the gray clouds that temporarily mask the pitiless heat and glare of the summer sun. This gives the sky and ground a silvery luminosity that is particular to desert landscapes, and transforms the desert itself into something that looks like a delicate construct of shimmering Venetian glass.<br> <br>Sometimes water can get trapped behind brush and debris that has blocked a dry streambed or arroyo, and when the pressure becomes more than the brush dam can bear, a flash flood is the result. The water takes on the appearance of a twisting, angry animal. The sound alone could scare you to death. There are huge boulders being rolled along at the bottom, making a menacing, growling rumble, and then the roar of the rushing wall of water, which can contain anything from huge logs to sections of some rancher&#x2019;s fence&#x2014;even his pickup truck.<br> <br>As very young children, we were warned to head immediately for high ground if there was any sign of rain on the horizon. We knew not to linger in the usually dry rivers and washes where we would spend hours hunting for sand rubies, Indian pottery shards, or maybe even gold. My father had taught us how to use a shallow pan and patiently wash the sand until you &#x201c;get a little color.&#x201d; The earth in Arizona is so mineral rich that sometimes we did see something glinting in the pan, but not very often and not enough to make us rich too.<br> <br>It was hot work moving around in the desert. We often went barefoot, but the ground in summer would become so hot that it could raise a blister. The remedy for this was to wet our feet, then dip them in the dry, powdery clay dust, then a little wet mud, and then back into the dust again until we had built up layers of earth to insulate us from the heat. We called this making &#x201c;mud huaraches,&#x201d; or sandals. It was very effective. If one weren&#x2019;t near a convenient hose or puddle, one simply ran from shade to shade, which seemed to exist in a sadistically meager quantity. The minute we were tall enough to climb onto the back of a horse, we added yet another layer to cushion us from the punishing hot ground.<br> <br><br> <br>The first thing I remember ever really wanting, besides the close proximity of my parents, was a horse. My desire for a horse was as fierce as hunger and thirst. I stared at pictures of them in my little books, and drew and colored them with my pencils and crayons&#x2014;usually colors like pale turquoise, lavender, and rosy pink, and not the more prosaic buckskin, bay, and sorrel colors that I observed on the hides of real horses.<br> <br>There was one little girl, two years my senior, who lived near enough to visit. One of eight children, her name was Dana, and she was friendly, smart, and had the thing I yearned for most, which was a pony of her own. Her pony was spotted black and white, his name was Little Paint, and a saintlier beast has never been born. Shetland ponies are often mischievous and can be quite naughty, bucking and biting and refusing to budge for their tiny riders. Who can blame them after all that we make them do, encumbering them with saddles and rigid metal bits and then expecting them to haul us around in the hot Arizona sun?<br> <br>Little Paint, a Shetland crossbred with the more sweet-natured and slightly bigger Welsh pony, was a perfect gentleman. Since there was only one of him, Dana and I would clamber up on his round back and ride double. He was a sturdy little fellow and bore us uncomplainingly wherever we bade him. We would also hitch him up to Dana&#x2019;s pony cart, and he would pull us alongside the blacktop road all the way to the Fort Lowell drugstore, which had a soda fountain. It was like having a car at age four.<br> <br>I began to beg my parents for a pony of my own, drooping around the house and visibly pining, hinting that without a pony I might not be expected to live. It being within months of my fifth birthday, my father, showing true mercy, decided to buy me a pony. In those days, this could be done for surprisingly little money.<br> <br>Dana&#x2019;s father operated a small farm nearby and was also a photographer. He photographed people&#x2019;s children dressed up in a cowboy suit and mounted on Little Paint. He had a second pony who had not been a successful picture pony&#x2014;most likely because he was all Shetland and less patient with the business of having cowboy-suited tots loaded on and off his back all day. His name was Murphy, Dana&#x2019;s last name being O&#x2019;Sullivan.<br> <br>Murphy was small and black, and with his shaggy winter coat, he looked exactly like a giant caterpillar. I fell in love with him immediately. My father made arrangements with Mr. O&#x2019;Sullivan, and Murphy came home to live with us.<br> <br>He was somewhat ill tempered and used to dump me off his back and run home, work the lid off the galvanized steel can where we kept his oats, and commence to eat his dinner. I would find him there chewing away after I hiked back, beet red in the face from the heat and the mortification of having him buck me off. I retaliated by taking Murphy inside our house, much cooler than his stable, and feeding him ice cream.<br> <br>Sometimes he would wriggle under the wire fence of his enclosure and cross blacktop roads humming with traffic to find the nearest subdivision, where one fellow grew a clover law...</p><h2>Old Testament Days: An Activity Guide (Hands-On History)</h2><p>More than 80 projects drawn from archaeological evidence and Bible descriptions make Old Testament days come alive in this activity guide for children ages 5 to 12.

Featured contributors include Jamaica Kincaid, bell hooks, Francisco X. Alarcon, Yusef Komunyakaa, Diane Glancy, and others.</p><p>Our perception of nature is a cultural construct formed in part by nature writing, which has long been dominated by Euro-American voices. The exclusion of writings by people of color about place, nature's wonders, and our species' uncanny ability to wreak havoc on the natural world has skewed and limited the genre, and cheated society out of a fuller understanding of the connection between social injustice and environmental destruction. Coeditors Deming, a poet and nature writer, and Savoy, a geologist, begin to remedy this omission with their unprecedented and invaluable collection of forthright and bracing essays by writers of "diverse cultural origins and disciplinary backgrounds." Jamaica Kincaid and Francisco X. Alarcon write about nature and imperialism in the "New" World. American Indian writer Joseph Bruchac writes about owls, turkeys, turtles, and protecting his ancestors' burial grounds from developers. Memories of her Kentucky hill childhood inspire bell hooks to portray nature-wise "country black folks," while poets and scientists ardently and knowledgeably discuss everything from parrots to ethnobotany, and environmental racism.

It began in 1901 as the "bible" for Mrs. Simon Kander's cooking classes, composed mostly of recent immigrants to Milwaukee. Despite language barriers, the young women were eager to assimilate and learn new skills for cooking typical American dishes. If Kander were to browse through the latest edition, assembled by New York food writer Pierce, she might be surprised to find a recipe for pad Thai opposite another for kreplach. Such is the international tone that the book adopts in its latest incarnation, in a decided shift away from assimilation to celebrating culinary differences. Old-fashioned basic fare is well represented, as befits the educational intent of the original. Yet an inexperienced and adventurous cook will also find an easy-to-prepare Spanish chili sauce, fragrant with fresh marjoram and garlic. Still targeted to beginners, the volume offers rundowns of cooking techniques, definitions of everything from skim milk to mache lettuce and nearly 800 pages of recipes.

In this adventure: Tintin comes to the U.S.A. to clean up the mean streets of Chicago but ends up in the wild west! Will Tintin make it back home? <br><br></p><p>Written in 1931, <i>Tintin in America</i> was chronologically the third Tintin adventure but is generally considered the first in the "official" canon. The stereotypes probably fit how a European would have looked at the New World, from Al Capone's gangsters in Chicago to a Native American tribe in the unfortunately named Redskin City, as Tintin and Snowy escape one peril after another in pursuit of villain Bobby Smiles. It's one of Herge's least complex--and least entertaining--tales, still worth a read but not a good introduction to the series as a whole. <i>--David Horiuchi</i>Herg�, one of the most famous Belgians in the world, was a comics writer and artist. The internationally successful Adventures of Tintin are his most well-known and beloved works. They have been translated into 38 different languages and have inspired such legends as Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.

The event, which came to be known as the Circeo massacre, shocked and captivated the country, exposing the violence and dark underbelly of the upper middle class at a moment when the traditional structures of family and religion were seen as under threat.</p><p>It is this environment, the halls of San Leone Magno in the late 1960s and the 1970s, that Edoardo Albinati takes as his subject. His experience at the school, reflections on his adolescence, and thoughts on the forces that produced contemporary Italy are painstakingly and thoughtfully rendered, producing a remarkable blend of memoir, coming-of-age novel, and true-crime story. Along with indelible portraits of his teachers and fellow classmates&#x2015;the charming Arbus, the literature teacher Cosmos, and his only Fascist friend, Max&#x2015;Albinati also gives us his nuanced reflections on the legacy of abuse, the Italian bourgeoisie, and the relationship between sex, violence, and masculinity.</p></p><p><p><b>Edoardo Albinati</b> is a novelist and screenwriter who lives in Rome.

He lives with his family in Barrington, Rhode Island.</p>PreSchool-Grade 2&#x2013;With lots of fun sound effects and multiple opportunities for voice modulation, this book begs to be read aloud. The story opens with an illustration of a boy snoozing in his bed. Suddenly, he sits up and clutches the covers to his chin. A night-light illuminates the room, revealing an open closet door. He explains, I cant sleep because theres a tiger in my closet... After hearing a Crunch! Crunch! Crunch! he adds, ...a tiger in my closet eating potato chips! As the antics continue, the child takes charge, repeatedly telling the big cat to quiet down. Each time, the creature apologizes, promises to be silent, and then proceeds on to the next noisy activity. When the boy hears a Boo-hoo, he discovers that Tiger is afraid of the dark and invites the animal into his bed. This story about nighttime fears features a youngster who takes on the role of an adult, while the childlike animal playfully refuses to settle down. The heavily shadowed closet interior contrasts sharply with the colorful and exuberant images of Tiger doing multiple tasks simultaneously, and the narrators delightfully expressive body language continues the comic relief.

In the nearby towers, some of which reached upwards of twenty storeys, random windows were lit, making haphazard patterns in the glass-and-steel grids, and some of those lights meant early-bird bankers were at their desks, getting a jump on the markets, but most were a sign that the other City workers were on the job, the ones who wore overalls, and whose pre-dawn tasks involved vacuuming, polishing, emptying bins. Paul Lowell&#x2019;s sympathies were with the latter. You either cleaned up other people&#x2019;s messes or you didn&#x2019;t&#x2014;and that was the class system for you, right there.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He glanced at the road below. Eighteen metres was a fair distance, viewed vertically. Dropping to his haunches he felt the relevant muscles crunch, and cheap fabric strain unpleasantly across his thighs. His suit was too small. Lowell had figured it was stretchy enough that this wouldn&#x2019;t matter, but in the event he felt constricted by it, and graced with none of the power he might have imagined it bestowing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or maybe he was just getting fat.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lowell was on a platform, which probably wasn&#x2019;t the correct architectural term for it, above an arch through which ran London Wall, the dual-lane thoroughfare reaching from St. Martin&#x2019;s-le-Grand to Moorgate. Above him was another tower block, part of a pair set at an angle to each other, and housing one of the world&#x2019;s leading investment banks as well as one of its most famous pizza chains. A hundred yards away, on a grassy knoll by the side of the road to which it had lent its name, ran a chunk of the Roman wall which had once encircled the City, still standing centuries after its builders had given up their ghosts. A symbol, it occurred to Lowell now. Some things endured, survived changing attitudes, and it was worth fighting to preserve what remained of them. Why he was here, in a nutshell.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shrugging his rucksack free he placed it between his knees, drew a zip and unpacked its contents. In an hour or so traffic would build, heading into the City or points east, a quantity of it passing through the arch on which he perched, and all those cars, taxis, buses and bikes would have no choice but to bear witness. And in their wake would come the inevitable: the news crews, the cameras, carrying his message to the nation.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . All he wanted was his voice to be heard. After years of being denied his rights he was ready to fight, and like others before him, had chosen a particular mode in which to do so. This was how traditions were born. He didn&#x2019;t for a moment think anything he achieved today would make a major difference, but others in his position would see, and learn, and maybe act. Someday, that difference would be made. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was movement, and he turned to see a figure hoisting itself onto the far end of the platform, having scaled the building from the street below as Lowell had ten minutes earlier. It took a second for recognition to sink in, but as soon as it did he felt a thump of excitement, as if he were twelve again. Because this was what every twelve-year-old wanted to see, he thought, as he watched the newcomer approach. This was the stuff young boys&#x2019; dreams were made of.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tall, broad and purposeful, Batman strode towards him through damp ribbons of fog.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; Lowell called. &#x201c;Nice one.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He looked down at his own costume. Spider-Man was hardly age-appropriate, but it wasn&#x2019;t like anyone would be offering style points: making the evening news was the aim, and superhero suits ticked the right media boxes. It had worked before and would work again. So he was the Amazing Spider-Man, and the comrade he was meeting for the first time now, with whom all arrangements had been made anonymously through a message board, was Batman, and the pair would be a dynamic duo for one morning only, and blaze through newscasts for the rest of the week. One hand on the roll of canvas he&#x2019;d unpacked, Lowell levered himself to his feet and extended the other, because this too was part of an ancient narrative: men meeting and greeting, and bonding in a common cause.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ignoring Spider-Man&#x2019;s outstretched hand, Batman punched him in the face.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lowell fell backwards as the world span out of control: lit-up office windows spiralled like stars, and all the air left his body as it hit damp brickwork. But already his mind had slipped into workgear, and he rolled sideways, away from the edge, as Batman&#x2019;s foot stamped down hard, just missing his elbow. He needed to be upright, because nobody ever won a fight from a prone position, and he concentrated on this for the next two seconds instead of wondering why Batman was kicking the shit out of him, and his focus almost paid off because he&#x2019;d made it to his knees before he was punched in the head again. Blood soaked through Lowell&#x2019;s Spider-Man mask. He tried to speak. A formless gargle was all he could manage.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then he was being dragged towards the edge of the platform. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He shrieked, because it was clear what would happen next. Batman was hauling him by the shoulders, and he couldn&#x2019;t break free&#x2014;the man&#x2019;s hands felt moulded from steel. He kicked out and hit the canvas lump, which rolled towards the edge, unravelling as it went. He swung an arm for Batman&#x2019;s crotch, but hit muscle-hard thigh instead. And then he was hanging in space, the only thing keeping him aloft the caped crusader&#x2019;s grip.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a moment they were locked in near-embrace, Batman rigidly upright, Spider-Man dangling, as if posing for a cover illustration.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;For pity&#x2019;s sake,&#x201d; Spider-Man whispered.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Batman dropped him.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The canvas roll had hit the road before Paul Lowell did but wasn&#x2019;t a roll by then, having unwound itself along the tarmac to become a strip of carpet instead of the banner he&#x2019;d intended it to be. In foot-high letters, its hand-painted battle-cry, <i>A FAIR DEAL FOR FEATHERS</i>, blurred as the wet ground soaked into the fabric, along with a certain quantity of Lowell&#x2019;s blood, but remained a gratifyingly newsworthy image, and would feature in many a broadcast before the day was out.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paul Lowell didn&#x2019;t see any of them, thought.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Batman, he was long gone.</p><h2>Ancient World: Internet Linked (World History)</h2><p>An illustrated description of ancient life-styles and cultures.</p><p></p><h2>Man Without Qualities, Vol. 2: The Like of It Now Happens (II)</h2><p>Cover marked and worn, some foxing to tanned page edges.

The Hamptons, valued for their bracing air, their exceptional views, and their fertile soil, drew dozens of the best families in New York and New England society, who made the area their summer playground. As one society matron remarked of Southampton, 'Southampton is a little backwater of God.' In this remarkable volume, filled with archival photographs, authors Gary Lawrance and Anne Surchin plunge the reader into this world of leisured, cultured existence. Their survey of more than 30 houses shows us treasures such as Ballyshear, Ocean Castle, The Bouwerie, and Port of Missing Men. They discuss the great architects of the period who designed these houses, including figures and firms such as Cross &amp; Cross, John Russell Pope, and Leroy P. Ward. Among those for whom they designed houses in the Hamptons were Henry Francis du Pont, Col. Henry Huttleston Rogers, and Ellery James. Houses of the Hamptons offers a fascinating glimpse into the privileged society of the turn of the century, one that has all but vanished from the modern world.<br><br>In the revised edition, four chapters have been added as well as a number of new and archival color illustrations.</p><p>Gary Lawrance, AIA, is an architect based in Stony Brook, NY.

Would it focus on the difficulties--the poor food, cramped quarters and lonely isolation? Paul&#39;s letter to the Philippians, written from prison, has no hint of self-pity. The letter radiates joy--joy that Christ was proclaimed, joy in fellowship with the Philippian Christians and, above all, joy in Jesus himself. In this volume of the Bible Speaks Today series, Alec Motyer identifies three major themes that filled Paul&#39;s heart and mind as he wrote: the unity of the church, the person of Jesus and what he has achieved, and the call to live a life worthy of the gospel.</p><p>J. Alec Motyer (1924&#x2013;2016) was a renowned Old Testament pastor and scholar. With extensive experience in parish ministry, he was principal of Trinity College in Bristol, England, and was well known as a Bible expositor. His books include <em>The Prophecy of Isaiah</em>, and he was the Old Testament editor of The Bible Speaks Today commentary series.</p><h2>100 Things to Know About Food</h2><p>Did you know that it takes 40,000 bees to fill an orchard with apples?

But Jennet&#x2019;s rescue, so long in coming, is not the resolution they&#x2019;d hoped for. In the spring she had given birth to Luke&#x2019;s son, and in the summer Jennet had found herself compelled to surrender the infant to a stranger in the hope of keeping him safe.<br><br>To claim the child, Hannah, Luke, and Jennet must journey first to Pensacola. There they learn a great deal about the family that has the baby. The Poiterins are a very rich, very powerful Creole family, totally without scruple. The matriarch of the family has left Pensacola for New Orleans and taken the child she now claims as her great-grandson with her.<br><br>New Orleans is a city on the brink of war, a city where prejudice thrives and where Hannah, half Mohawk, must tread softly. Careful plans are made as the Bonners set out to find and reclaim young Nathaniel Bonner. Plans that go terribly awry, isolating them from each other in a dangerous city at the worst of times.<br><br>Sure that all is lost, and sick unto death, Hannah finds herself in the care of a family and a friend from her past, Dr. Paul de Guise Savard dit Saint-d&#x2019;Uzet. It is Dr. Savard and his wife who save Hannah&#x2019;s life, but Dr. Savard&#x2019;s half brother who offers her real hope. Jean-Benoit Savard, the great-grandson of French settlers, slaves, and Choctaw and Seminole Indians, is the one man who knows the city well enough to engineer the miracle that will reunite the Bonners and send them home to Lake in the Clouds. With Ben Savard&#x2019;s guidance, allies are drawn from every segment of New Orleans&#x2019;s population and from Andrew Jackson&#x2019;s army, now pouring into the city in preparation for what will be the last major battle of the War of 1812.</p><p>Sara Donati is the pen name of Rosina Lippi. She lives with her husband, daughter, and various pets in an area between the Cascade Mountains and the Puget Sound.<i>Chapter One<br>L'Ile de Lamantins<br>French Antilles<br>August 1814<br></i><br>The island, beautiful and treacherous, drew in the love-struck and rewarded them with razor-sharp coral reefs, murderous breakwaters, and cliffs that no man sane man would attempt.<br><br>Kit Wyndham was sane. Out of his depth, perhaps, but Major Christian Pelham Wyndham of the King's Rangers was in command of all his senses, while Luke Scott was not.<br><br>"Major?"<br><br>The lieutenant hovered like a maiden aunt, stopping just short of wringing his hands. If given permission to speak, Hodge would say out loud what he had said too many times already: that they had no business here; that what Scott intended was madness.<br><br>Hodge was wrong about one thing: They did have business here, and crucial business at that. The only kind of business that could have forged this strange alliance between himself and the Scotts: They were after the same prey.<br><br>A fat moon hung in a clear night sky, sending the shadows of masts and rigging out to dance on the water. On the rail his own hands were drained of color, corpse gray.<br><br>He turned to assure his lieutenant that he would have no part in this night's insanity. Let Scott take his band of mercenaries and storm Priest's Town, and good luck to them one and all. Kit Wyndham had made a promise, and he would keep it: Now that their quarry was in sight, he would step back and let Scott lead.<br><br>Just behind Lieutenant Hodge stood Hannah Scott, dressed in men's breeches and a leather jerkin over a rough shirt, her person hung about with weapons: a rifle on her back, pistols, a knife in a beaded sheath on a broad belt. She could heal or kill; he had seen her conjure miracles and blasphemies with equal ease. No mortal woman, he had called her to her face, and she had not corrected him with words.<br><br>The moonlight was kind to her, as the sun was kind. In the year since they had made their uneasy alliance he had seen her every day, and still the sight of her was startling. By the standards of Wyndham's own kind, Luke Scott's Mohawk half sister could not be called beautiful. Her skin was too dark, her hair too black, her mouth too generous for pale English blood. Below deep-set eyes the bosses of her cheeks cast shadows. Most damning of all, the expression in those eyes was far and away too intelligent. If her skin were as pale as cream, her mind would have isolated her; Englishmen did not know what to do with such a woman.<br><br>Even at this moment she knew exactly what he was thinking, the excuses he had been ready to offer, the rationalizations. If he voiced them she would simply tilt her head and look at him. She would call him no names, but he would hear them anyway.<br><br>"Major?" Lieutenant Hodge's voice rose and wavered.<br><br>He said, "Fetch my weapons." And: "Miss Scott, please tell your brother I will be joining the rescue party."<br>All this, for a woman.<br><br>The men liked to speculate, when Luke Scott was out of their hearing, how much money had been spent on this year long crusade, by the woman's kinfolk and the Crown. Scott wanted his wife back; none of the men doubted that for a minute. He wasn't the kind of man who would let himself be robbed, not Luke Scott. But it seemed that there was more at stake, something nobody was talking about. The fact that Wyndham had been sent after Degre at the same time made that clear.<br><br>No expense had been spared. First there was the Isis, the great merchantman sitting idle in the waters off Kingston. She was too clumsy a ship for the kind of work they had to do in the islands, and so Scott had purchased the schooner Patience as thoughtlessly as another man might put down coin for bread and ale. The crew was well paid and the provisions&#x2014;meat and biscuit and ale and rum&#x2014;were generous. Beyond the material things, the Earl of Carryck and the Scotts had put down a fortune in pursuit of information.<br><br>Kit Wyndham stood back and watched the Scotts contrive. Their money was of less interest to him; he was born to wealth and had been raised among people who knew how to spend it. His family had been cultivating those skills for generations; his mother and sisters were experts. When Scott spent money he bought results. Fast ships, good men, names whispered in dark corners, maps drawn with a bit of charcoal on a tabletop.<br><br>Scott's men were expert soldiers, utterly silent, ruthless to a fault, loyal unto death. Part of that was generosity with coin, but not the biggest part. Kit had known men like these when he was in Spain under Wellington.<br><br>Now was not the time to think of Spain. He put those images out of his head and concentrated on the back of the man in front of him, called Dieppe. Scott's most important find: a small, quick, wiry man, his skin the deep true black of the enslaved African.<br><br>Just last month Scott had found Dieppe in St. Croix and bought him for more than he was worth. Then he offered the African his freedom in return for one night's work. It was Dieppe who knew the reefs that built a fortress around this island. Without him they would need an army to take it, and no doubt the lady would die before they could get to her.<br><br>Night birds called, and their voices echoed off the water as the longboat wound its way through a swamp crowded by an army of mangrove trees. A sinuous tail as broad around as a man's waist flicked in the moonlight, and Wyndham touched the long knife at his side. He had seen an alligator twenty feet long rip the leg off a man with a jerk of his head.<br><br>Dieppe led them onto land so saturated with water that to stand still was to invite disaster. They followed one by one: Scott, his sister, then the others made a long coiling snake with Dieppe as the head. Dieppe and Scott and some of the other men carried machetes; Wyndham had his short sword.<br><br>For two hours they walked through the damp heat of the swamp in the wake of the swinging blades. Tiny gnats gathered at nostrils and the corners of lips and eyes, and Wyndham wiped them away with the back of his hand, thinking of the ointment he had been offered and turned down.<br><br>The lagoons, then, as they had been told: long commas of water silvered by the moonlight. The men broke into a trot until they came to the edge of the forest, where they stopped for five minutes while Dieppe and Scott spoke, heads bent together.<br><br>The swamps were bad, but these forests were worse. Wyndham concentrated on putting one foot in front of the other and not losing sight of the man in front of him. Something screamed, and the hairs on the back of his neck rose. This dark and fragrant place could hardly be more different from Spain's hot exposed plains and rocky hills, but his blood pounded here as it had there, and would spill the same bright color.<br><br>When they came out of the forest Wyndham touched his pistols and his sword lightly, and looking up, caught Hannah Scott's gaze on him. He had seen her kill, but she knew nothing of him in the field, except the stories told behind his back. Most of them were perfectly true.<br>The cove was small, well protected from the winds, and unguarded. Looking down on it they saw two ships&#x2013;Degre's <i>Grasshopper</i>, and another unknown to them. If Scott had sailed the Patience into the cove and tried to walk up the path that had been cut into the cliff face, then perhaps one of the men sleeping with an empty bottle cradled between his legs might have woke to sound the alarm. As it was, they died quietly.<br><br>Scott sent half the men to deal with the ships, and the rest of them went into the settlement called Priest's Town. It turned out to be nothing more than a warren of shacks set up off the ground, most of them empty. Two old mulatto women lived in the smallest of them with their goats and swine. They seemed neither surprised to be roused by strange soldiers in the middle of the night, nor worried about their lives. That was another talent of Scott's: he could dispense calm as easily as coin. People trusted him, even when they should not. He could be kind, if it furthered his cause; but ruthlessness came to him just as easily. He would have gone far in the army.<br><br>The raiders turned their attention to the largest of the shacks. Directly in the middle, the largest room's outer wall was made of a series of doors, all open to the weather. A rail hung from the sagging porch like a broken arm. Lanterns swayed from blackened posts, some of them dead, others guttering and spewing black smoke. The inside of the house was crowded.<br><br>Scott's men moved like a company who had fought together in a dozen campaigns, silently, easily, joined by invisible threads just tense enough to keep them aware of each other. Kit tested the weight of his rifle, as familiar to him as any part of his body. The bayonet clicked into place. It caught what light there was and winked at him.<br><br>They waited for the guide, ten minutes, twenty, and then Dieppe came back, sweat covered, trembling. Scott asked him a question in rapid French, and got a nod in answer.<br><br>"A child? Did you see an infant?"<br><br>"<i>Non</i>." Sure of himself, of what he hadn't seen.<br><br>For the first time tonight, Wyndham saw Scott hesitate. No doubt he had been hoping to find the woman and her child together. If there was a child.<br><br>Again he felt Hannah Scott's gaze on him, as if she were reading his thoughts, and answering them.<br><br>It was an argument they had had too many times: whether or not the information they had about the woman's condition was to be trusted. Scott believed it was true; Wyndham was doubtful. The old woman who had told them that the lady they were after was heavy with child might simply have been looking for more coin.<br><br>In a few minutes they would know. Scott sent some of the men around to the back, and gave them orders to wait for his signal.<br>Wyndham saw the room for a s...</p><h2>A Theory Of Justice</h2><p>Though the revised edition of <i>A Theory of Justice</i>, published in 1999, is the definitive statement of Rawls's view, so much of the extensive literature on Rawls's theory refers to the first edition.

But Aquila, a young legionnaire, chooses to stay behind, in order to join the fight to save his native land. <br></p><p><p><strong>Rosemary Sutcliff </strong>(1920-1992) was born in Surrey, England. A voracious private reader, she left her regular studies at fourteen to attend art school. In 1950 her first children's book was published, and from then on, she devoted her time and talents to writing children's historical novels. Many of her books are set in Roman Britain, a period that particularly interested her. She received the OBE in 1975 and, in 1992, was awarded the CBE. She was still writing on the morning of her death at the age of seventy-two.</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>Aquila halted on the edge of the hanging woods, looking down. Below him he could see the farmstead under the great, bare swell of the downs; the russet-roofed huddle of buildings, the orchard behind, making a darker pattern on the paleness of the open turf, the barley just beginning to show its first tinge of harvest gold, the stream that rose under the orchard wall and wandered down the valley to turn the creaking wheel of the water-mill that ground their corn.</p><p>Almost a year had gone by since the last time that he had stood here and looked down, for it was only last night that he had come home on leave from Rutupiae, where he commanded a troop of Rhenus Horse&#x2014;Auxiliary Cavalry; there had been no regular Legions in Britain for forty years now&#x2014;and every detail of the scene gave him a sharp-edged pleasure. It was good to be home. And really, the place didn&#x2019;t look so bad. It was not what it had been in the good old days, of course. Kuno, who was the oldest man on the farm, could remember when there had been vine terraces on the south slope; you could see the traces of them still, just below the woods here, like the traces of the old fields and the old sheep-runs that had had to be let go back to the wild. It was the Pict War that had done the mischief, so long ago that even Kuno couldn&#x2019;t remember, though he swore that he could, and, when he had drunk enough heather beer, used to tell everybody how he had seen the great Theodosius himself, when he came to drive out the Saxons and the Painted People. But though Theodosius had swept Britain clear, the damage had been done and the countryside had never been the same again. The great houses had been burned, the slaves had revolted against their masters, and the big estates had been ruined. It hadn&#x2019;t been so bad for the small estates and farms, especially those that were not worked with slave labour. Kuno was very fond of telling&#x2014;and the hearing of it always made Aquila feel humble, though he was sure that it should make him proud&#x2014;how in the bad time, the Killing Time, when the slaves revolted, the free men of his own farm had kept faith with his great-grandfather.</p><p>Because he was seeing his home again for the first time in almost a year, he was piercingly aware of it, and the things it stood for, and aware also how easily it might be lost. Old Tiberius&#x2019;s farm, not many miles further seaward, had been burned by the Saxon raiders last year. When you thought about it, you realized that you were living in a world that might fall to pieces at any moment; but Aquila seldom thought about it much. He had lived in that world all his life, and so had at least three generations of his kind before him, and it hadn&#x2019;t fallen to pieces yet, and it didn&#x2019;t seem likely that it would do so on this rich, ripening day with the powdery whiteness of July lying over the countryside.</p><p>There was the sound of flying feet behind him, and a brushing through the undergrowth and Flavia his sister was beside him, demanding breathlessly, &#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t you wait for me?&#x201d;</p><p>Aquila turned his head to look at her. &#x201c;I got tired of propping up the wall of Sabra&#x2019;s cot, being stared out of countenance by that yellow-eyed cat of hers, while you chittered inside.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You could have stayed inside and chittered too.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t want to, thank you. Besides, I wanted to get back here and make sure the farm hadn&#x2019;t run away since breakfast.&#x201d; It was an odd thing to say, born of his sudden, unusual awareness, and they looked at each other quickly.</p><p>&#x201c;It is queer how one feels like that sometimes,&#x201d; the girl said, grave for the moment. And then the shadow passed, and she was sparkling again. &#x201c;But it hasn&#x2019;t run away&#x2014;and oh! it is so lovely that you are home again, Aquila! And look, here&#x2019;s honeysuckle with crimson tips; and here&#x2019;s clover, and blue scabious, as blue as a butterfly. I shall make a wreath for myself for dinner as though it were a banquet; just for myself, and not for you or Father at all, because men look silly in banquet wreaths, especially if they have galley-prow noses like yours!&#x201d; And while she spoke, she was down on her knees, searching among the leaves for the tough, slender scabious stems.</p><p>Aquila leaned against a tree and watched her, making a discovery. &#x201c;You have grown up while I have been away.&#x201d;</p><p>She looked up, the flowers in her hands. &#x201c;I was grown up before you went away. More than fifteen. And now I&#x2019;m more than sixteen&#x2014;quite old.&#x201d;</p><p>Aquila wagged his head sadly. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I say. I don&#x2019;t suppose you can even run now.&#x201d;</p><p>She sprang up, her face alight with laughter. &#x201c;What will you wager me that I do not reach the terrace steps ahead of you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A new pair of crimson slippers against a silver buckle for my sword-belt.&#x201d; Aquila pushed himself from the tree-trunk as she swooped up the skirt of her yellow tunic with the flowers in its lap.</p><p>&#x201c;Done! Are you ready?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. Now!&#x201d;</p><p>They sprang away side by side over the short downland turf, by the level-and-drop of the old vine terraces, by the waste strip at the head of the cornland where the plough team turned, skirting the steading yard on flying feet. Flavia was half a spear&#x2019;s length ahead of him as they reached the steps of the terrace before the house and whirled about under the old spreading damson tree that grew there. &#x201c;Well? Can I still run? I can run faster than you can now, and I&#x2019;m a girl!&#x201d;</p><p>Aquila caught her by the wrist. &#x201c;You have sharp, hollow bones like a bird, and it is not fair.&#x201d; They flung themselves down on the step, panting and laughing, and he turned to look at her. He loved being with Flavia again, he always had loved being with her, even when they were small. She was two years younger than he was, but Demetrius, their Greek tutor, declared that they had been meant to be twins and something had gone wrong with their stars to bring about the two years one must wait for the other. Flavia&#x2019;s hair had come down and was flying about her shoulders; hair as black and harsh as a stallion&#x2019;s mane, and so full of life that she could comb sparks out of it when she combed it in the dark. He reached out and gave it a small, brotherly tug.</p><p>&#x201c;Brute!&#x201d; Flavia said happily. She drew up her knees and clasped her arms round them, tipping up her head to the sunshine that rimmed the damson leaves with gold and made the little dark damsons seem almost transparent. &#x201c;I do love being alive! I love the way things look and feel and smell! I love the dustiness of July, and the dry singing the wind makes through the grass, and the way the stones are warm to sit on, and the way the honeysuckle smells!&#x201d;</p><p>There was something almost fierce under her laughter; but that was always the way with Flavia: the fierceness and the laughter and the sparks flying out of her hair. She turned to him with a swift flash of movement. All her movements were swift and flashing. &#x201c;Show me the dolphin again.&#x201d;</p><p>With an air of long-suffering, Aquila pulled up the loose sleeve of his tunic and showed her, as he had showed her yesterday evening, the dolphin badge of their family rather inexpertly tattooed on the brown skin of his shoulder. One of the Decurions at Rutupiae had learned the trick from a Pictish hostage, and during the bad weather, when there was not much else to do, several of them had let him try his skill on them.</p><p>Flavia ran a fingertip over the blue lines. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure that I like it. You&#x2019;re not a Pict.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If I had been, I&#x2019;d have had stripes and spirals all over me, not a nice neat little dolphin...It might come in very useful. If I were away from home for a long, long time, and when I came back nobody knew me again, like Odysseus, I could take you quietly aside and say, &#x2018;Look, I&#x2019;ve got a dolphin on my shoulder. I&#x2019;m your long-lost brother.&#x2019; And then you&#x2019;d know me again, like the old slave when she found the scar of the boar&#x2019;s tusk on Odysseus&#x2019;s thigh.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe I&#x2019;d say, &#x2018;Oh, stranger, anyone may get a dolphin tattooed on his shoulder.&#x2019; I&#x2019;d be more likely to recognize you by your nose, however long that had been away.&#x201d; She turned to the tangle of honeysuckle and small downland flowers in her lap, and began to arrange them for her garland. &#x201c;Are you as glad to be home as we are to have you, even though it is only one year and not twenty, like Odysseus?&#x201d;</p><p>Aquila nodded, glancing about him at the familiar scene. From close quarters one could see more clearly that the farm had known better days: the outbuildings that needed re-roofing, the wing of the house that had once been lived in and was now a grain-store, the general air of a place run without quite enough money, without quite enough men. But the pigeons were paddling in the sunlight below the terrace steps, and a flicker of brilliant blue showed where Gwyna was coming up with a milk-pail; and he was home again, sitting on the sun-warmed steps where they had sat as children, talking nonsense with Flavia.</p><p>Something moved in the farmyard, and Flavian their father came out from the stable, talking with Demetrius. Demetrius, who never smiled himself, said something at which their father laughed, flinging up his head like a boy; then he turned and came striding up toward the terrace, with Margarita his old wolfhound at his heels.</p><p>Aquila half-rose as he drew near. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re sitting on the terrace steps; come and join us, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>And their father came and sat down on the top step, with Margarita between his knees.</p><p>&#x201c;Aquila owes me a pair of crimson slippers,&#x201d; Flavia said, reaching up to lay an arm across his knee. &#x201c;He said I was grown up and couldn&#x2019;t run anymore.&#x201d;</p><p>Their father smiled. &#x201c;And you aren&#x2019;t, and you can. I heard the two of you skirling like curlews all the way down from the top woods. Mind you keep him up to paying his wager!&#x201d;</p><p>He was fondling Margarita&#x2019;s ears, drawing them again and again through his fingers, and the freckled sunlight under the leaves made small, shifting sparks of green fire in the flawed emerald of his great signet ring with its engraved dolphin.</p><p>Aquila twisted on his lower step to look up at him. It was hard to realize that Father was blind. There was nothing to show for it but the small scar that the Saxon arrow had made in his temple; and he came and went about the farm with that quick, sure stride, never seeming at a loss to know where he was or in what direction he wanted to go. Now he turned to his son and asked, &#x201c;How does the farm look to you, after a year away?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The farm looks good to me,&#x201d; Aquila said, and added with perhaps a little too much vehemence, &#x201c;it looks so sure&#x2014;as though it had been here as long as the downs have been here, and must last as long as the downs remain.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I wonder,&#x201d; their father said, suddenly grave. &#x201c;I wonder how long it will last&#x2014;just how long any of this life that we know will last.&#x201d;</p><p>Aquila shifted abruptly. &#x201c;Oh, I know...But the worst never seems to happen.&#x201d; Yet the worst happened to Tiberius, last year, said something in his mind, and he hurried on, as much to silence it as anything else: &#x201c;When Vortigern called in that Saxon war band and settled them in the old Iceni territory to hold off the Picts, five&#x2014;no, six years ago, everyone wagged their heads and said it was the end of Britain. They said it was calling the wolf in over the threshold; but Hengest and his crew haven&#x2019;t done so badly. Settled quite peacefully, seemingly; and they have held off the Picts, and left us free to concentrate what Auxiliaries we still have along the Saxon shore to hold off their pirate brothers. Maybe Vortigern wasn&#x2019;t such a fool after all.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you really think that?&#x201d; his father said very quietly, and his fingers checked on Margarita&#x2019;s ears.</p><p>&#x201c;It is what quite a lot of the others at Rutupiae think.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The temper of the Eagles has changed since my day. Do you think it?&#x201d;</p><p>There was a moment&#x2019;s silence and then Aquila said, &#x201c;No, I suppose not, really. But it is more comfortable to think that way.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Rome has done too much of thinking what is comfortable,&#x201d; his father said.</p><p>But Aquila was not for the moment listening. He was looking away down the valley to where a small figure had just come into sight on the wagon-way that led up from the ford and the ancient track under the downs. &#x201c;Sa ha,&#x201d; he said softly, &#x201c;someone coming.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who is it?&#x201d; said his father.</p><p>&#x201c;No one I know. A little bent man&#x2014;looks as though he&#x2019;s carrying a basket on his back.&#x201d;</p><p>He thought that both his father and Flavia were suddenly alert in a way that he did not understand. He thought that there was a feeling of waiting about them. A few moments went by, and then his father asked, &#x201c;Can you see yet what it is that he carries?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. It is a basket. And something else&#x2014;a lantern on a pole. I believe he is one of those wandering bird-catchers.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So. Stand up and signal to him to come to me here.&#x201d;</p><p>Aquila glanced at his father in puzzled surprise, then stood up and waved his arm above his head until the small, trudging figure saw the signal and flung up an arm in reply. &#x201c;He is coming,&#x201d; he said, and sat down again.</p><p>A short while later a small, earth-coloured man with a sharply pointed face like a water rat&#x2019;s came round the corner of the outbuildings and stood before the terrace steps, swinging the great reed basket from his shoulders almost before he had come to a halt. &#x201c;I greet my lord. My lord would like some fine fat quails, only caught this morning?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Take them up to the kitchen,&#x201d; Flavian said. &#x201c;It is a long time since you were here last.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I have had a long walk since I was here last,&#x201d; the man returned, and something in his rather hurried voice suggested the reply was a thing arranged beforehand. &#x201c;It is all of two hundred miles from Venta to the mountains.&#x201d;</p><p>As he spoke the words, he glanced aside out of doubtful dark eyes at Aquila, and Flavian, seeming to sense the swift, uneasy glance, said, &#x201c;Nay, there is nothing that need make you ill at ease, friend. My son is quite to be trusted.&#x201d; He took a slim wax tablet from the breast of his tunic. &#x201c;The quails up to the kitchen. My steward will pay you. And this to the usual place.&#x201d;</p><p>The man took the tablet without looking at it, and stowed it in the ragged breast of his own tunic. &#x201c;As my lord bids me,&#x201d; he said. He made a wide gesture of farewell that took in all three of them, and shouldering his basket again, turned and trudged off round the corner of the house toward the kitchen quarters.</p><p>Aquila watched him go, then turned back to his father. &#x201c;And what did that mean, sir?&#x201d; He thought Flavia knew.</p><p>Flavian gave a final pull to the old hound&#x2019;s ear, and released her with a pat. &#x201c;It means a message up to Dynas Ffaraon in the Arfon mountains.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So?&#x201d; Aquila said. &#x201c;What message is that?&#x201d;</p><p>There was a little silence, but he knew that his father was going to tell him.</p><p>&#x201c;I am going back into ancient history,&#x201d; Flavian said at last. &#x201c;Much of it you will know, but bear with me nonetheless, it is better to have the whole thing...</p><p>&#x201c;When Theodosius came to drive out the Picts that old Kuno so dearly loves to talk about, his lieutenant was one Magnus Maximus, a Spaniard. And when Theodosius went south again, he left Maximus in command behind him. Maximus married a British princess, daughter of the line that had ruled in the mountains of Northern Cymru since before we Romans came to Britain; and owing in part to his wife&#x2019;s blood, years later the British troops proclaimed him Emperor in opposition to Gratian.

Time and space are given names, points, and limits; seemingly intractable problems of motion, growth, and form are reduced to answerable questions.

For these spirits are the guardians of Robicheaux's darkest torments -- and they hold the key to his ultimate salvation...or a final, fatal downfall.</p></p><p>From one of America&#39;s most widely acclaimed writers comes a masterwork of detective fiction, the most suspenseful, thematically complex, and dazzling accomplishment in the series featuring Dave Robicheaux. A movie crew has come to New Iberia, Louisiana, to film a Civil War epic, and star Elrod Sykes just can&#39;t seem to keep his lavender Cadillac on the road. Under threat of a drunk-driving charge, he offers Detective Dave Robicheaux information in exchange for leniency: he leads him to the skeletal remains of a black man whose murder Robicheaux witnessed in the summer of 1957 as a college freshman. The still-unsolved crime haunts him as he grapples with a more pressing, contemporary horror, the serial rape and murder of young prostitutes. When the FBI arrives in the person of agent Rosie Gomez, Robicheaux must form a new partnership that challenges how he views himself and his local community, where officials have joined forces with such dubious &#34;talent&#34; as Julie &#34;Baby Feet&#34; Balboni, an investor in the movie project that is generating much-needed income for the region. It is only when Dave makes the acquaintance of the legendary Confederate cavalry officer General John Bell Hood in the mist of the bayou that he begins to understand that &#34;the war is never over&#34;, and that the battle rages on. James Lee Burke&#39;s brilliant handling of a multilayered plot, entwined with a reverie on the death of the chivalric code in the South, makes for a stunning novel in a series that is redefining the genre.James Lee Burke is the author of nineteen novels, including eleven starring the Detective Dave Robicheaux.

The resulting tale of "power and manipulation" is so complex, involving Hollywood, mob and political figures as well as government investigations, that it may try the patience of many readers. Recounting MCA's 62-year rise from Chicago dance-band booking agents into the "General Motors of Hollywood," Moldea (The Hoffa Wars charges that Reagan, while Screen Actors Guild president in the early 1950s, helped create the unprecedented deal that made MCA a powerful force in TV. While wrongdoing has never been proven, Reagan has since benefited financially and politically from close links with MCA heads Jules Stein and Lew Wasserman, he charges. Moldea uses government documents to raise serious questions. 50,000 first printing; author tour. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.A smoldering indictment of the Hollywood entertainment industry's guilt-by-association ties to organized crime. Using previously classified documents, crime reporter Moldea spins several tales in this extraordinary book, principally the rise of Music Corporation of America (MCA) from a fledgling band-booking company in 1924 to Hollywood's most powerful TV, film, and recording conglomerate, and the entwined journey of MCA client Reagan from mediocre actor to U.S. President. Moldea's story is no easy read, with its plethora of characters, facts, and footnotes. The sad conclusion is that although, for the most part, MCA and Reagan have done nothing technically illegal (i.e., indictable) in their ruthless quest for power and success, they have used every means available, including mobsters and corrupt politicians and union officials.

Written between 1914 and 1921, Ulysses has survived bowdlerization, legal action and bitter controversy. An undisputed modernist classic, its ceaseless verbal inventiveness and astonishing wide-ranging allusions confirms its standing as an imperishable monument to the human condition. Declan Kiberd says in his introduction that Ulysses is &#39;an endlessly open book of utopian epiphanies. It holds a mirror up to the colonial capital that was Dublin on 16 June 1904, but it also offers redemptive glimpses of a future world which might be made over in terms of those utopian moments.&#39; This Annotated Student Edition has full explanatory notes and line numbers for critical reference.</p><p><i>Ulysses</i> has been labeled dirty, blasphemous, and unreadable. In a famous 1933 court decision, Judge John M. Woolsey declared it an emetic book--although he found it sufficiently unobscene to allow its importation into the United States--and Virginia Woolf was moved to decry James Joyce's "cloacal obsession." None of these adjectives, however, do the slightest justice to the novel. To this day it remains <i>the</i> modernist masterpiece, in which the author takes both Celtic lyricism and vulgarity to splendid extremes. It is funny, sorrowful, and even (in a close-focus sort of way) suspenseful. And despite the exegetical industry that has sprung up in the last 75 years, <i>Ulysses</i> is also a compulsively readable book. Even the verbal vaudeville of the final chapters can be navigated with relative ease, as long as you're willing to be buffeted, tickled, challenged, and (occasionally) vexed by Joyce's sheer command of the English language.<p> Among other things, a novel is simply a long story, and the first question about any story is: <i>What happens?</i>. In the case of <i>Ulysses</i>, the answer might be <i>Everything</i>. William Blake, one of literature's sublime myopics, saw the universe in a grain of sand. Joyce saw it in Dublin, Ireland, on June 16, 1904, a day distinguished by its utter normality. Two characters, Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom, go about their separate business, crossing paths with a gallery of indelible Dubliners. We watch them teach, eat, stroll the streets, argue, and (in Bloom's case) masturbate. And thanks to the book's stream-of-consciousness technique--which suggests no mere stream but an impossibly deep, swift-running river--we're privy to their thoughts, emotions, and memories. The result? Almost every variety of human experience is crammed into the accordian folds of a single day, which makes <i>Ulysses</i> not just an experimental work but the very last word in realism. </p><p> Both characters add their glorious intonations to the music of Joyce's prose. Dedalus's accent--that of a freelance aesthetician, who dabbles here and there in what we might call Early Yeats Lite--will be familiar to readers of <i>Portrait of an Artist As a Young Man</i>. But Bloom's wistful sensualism (and naive curiosity) is something else entirely. Seen through his eyes, a rundown corner of a Dublin graveyard is a figure for hope and hopelessness, mortality and dogged survival: "Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels, crosses, broken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast eyes, old Ireland's hearts and hands. More sensible to spend the money on some charity for the living. Pray for the repose of the soul of. Does anybody really?" --<i>James Marcus</i></p>The 1934 text, as corrected and reset in 1961. Ulysses is one of the most influential novels of the twentieth century. It was not easy to find a publisher in America willing to take it on, and when Jane Jeap and Margaret Anderson started printing extracts from the book their literary magazine The Little Review in 1918, they were arrested and charged with publishing obscenity. They were fined $100, and even The New York Times expressed satisfaction with their conviction. Ulysses was not published in book form until 1922, when another American woman, Sylvia Beach, published it in Paris for her Shakespeare &amp; Company. Ulysses was not available legally in any English-speaking country until 1934, when Random House successfully defended Joyce against obscenity charges and published it in the Modern Library. This edition follows the complete and unabridged text as corrected and reset in 1961. Judge John Woolsey's decision lifting the ban against Ulysses is reprinted, along with a letter from Joyce to Bennett Cerf, the publisher of Random House, and the original foreword to the book by Morris L.

Though the daughter of an earl, Sophie has been relegated to the role of servant by her disdainful stepmother. But now, spinning in the strong arms of the debonair and devastatingly handsome Benedict Bridgerton, she feels like royalty. Alas, she knows all enchantments must end when the clock strikes midnight. Ever since that magical night, a radiant vision in silver has blinded Benedict to the attractions of any other - except, perhaps, this alluring and oddly familiar beauty dressed in housemaid&#39;s garb whom he feels compelled to rescue from a most disagreeable situation. He has sworn to find and wed his mystery miss, but this breathtaking maid makes him weak with wanting her. Yet, if he offers her his heart, will Benedict sacrifice his only chance for a fairy tale love?</p><p>Setting: Regency England<p> Sensuality: 7</p><p> Miss Sophie Beckett is the illegitimate daughter of the earl of Penwood. Raised in his home, Sophie has a tolerable existence until the earl marries, when her life takes a distinct turn for the worse. Sophie's new stepmother hates her, and when the earl passes away, she relegates Sophie to the role of servant. Sophie's days are pure drudgery, until one night her fellow servants conspire to help her attend a masquerade ball.</p><p> Her life changes irrevocably when she meets handsome Benedict Bridgerton and falls head over heels in love. Benedict is equally smitten, but when the clock strikes midnight his beautiful mystery lady runs from him, leaving only her glove in his hand. He searches London for her, but she seems to have vanished. What Benedict doesn't know is that Sophie's stepmother has discovered her outing and thrown Sophie out of their London townhouse. Sophie leaves London, and it isn't until three years later that Benedict and Sophie's paths cross once again, when he saves her from the unwanted attentions of a drunken lord. Sophie recognizes Benedict immediately, but much to her dismay, he doesn't know her in her maid's dress. Soon, however, Benedict falls in love with Sophie all over again. Believing her to be a servant, he cannot conceive of a way to make her his, as she adamantly refuses to become his mistress. Both struggle with their feelings for each other, their unwillingness to compromise their principles, and the seemingly insurmountable wall separating a member of the nobility and a servant.

After a distinguished teaching career he has emerged as one of the outstanding narrative historians of his generation.James, a British historian whose previous books have dealt chiefly with military matters, writes engagingly about the British Empire from the time of Sir Walter Raleigh at the beginning of the 17th century to Nelson Mandela at the end of the 20th. The struggle that drove France out of Canada, he says, was "Britain's first large-scale imperial war of conquest," and it set the pattern for future colonial wars from the American Revolution through the Napoleonic, Crimean, Boer, Afghan and Opium wars to WWI and the beginning of the end of the empire in India, Ireland, the Middle East and Africa. WWII finished the job. Except for the travels of Captain James Cook, tales of exploration play almost no part in this account. It is, instead, a history of how a fairly simple international mercantile enterprise?in which white dominions were definitely regarded differently from black ones?changed itself and the face of the world. James peppers his account with illuminating and entertaining excerpts from period songs and popular literature. His conclusion: few empires have given their subjects so much of the intellectual wherewithal to overthrow their rulers. A sprawling and complex subject handled with admirable style and selectivity.

In a luxurious apartment on the Mergellina beach the bodies of a fascist militia officer and his wife have been found.

He and the little girl were holding hands and walking up Third Avenue in New York City, walking fast, almost running. He looked back over his shoulder and the green car was still there, crawling along slowly in the curbside lane.<br> <br>&#x201c;Please, Daddy. Please.&#x201d;<br> <br>He looked at her and saw how pale her face was. There were dark circles under her eyes. He picked her up and sat her in the crook of his arm, but he didn&#x2019;t know how long he could go on like that. He was tired, too, and Charlie was no lightweight anymore.<br> <br>It was five-thirty in the afternoon and Third Avenue was clogged. They were crossing streets in the upper Sixties now, and these cross streets were both darker and less populated.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But that was what he was afraid of.<br> <br>They bumped into a lady pushing a walker full of groceries. &#x201c;Look where you&#x2019;re goin, whyn&#x2019;t ya?&#x201d; she said, and was gone, swallowed in the hurrying crowds.<br> <br>His arm was getting tired, and he switched Charlie to the other one. He snatched another look behind, and the green car was still there, still pacing them, about half a block behind. There were two men in the front seat and, he thought, a third in the back.<br> <br>What do I do now?<br> <br>He didn&#x2019;t know the answer to that. He was tired and scared and it was hard to think. They had caught him at a bad time, and the bastards probably knew it. What he wanted to do was just sit down on the dirty curbing and cry out his frustration and fear. But that was no answer. He was the grownup. He would have to think for both of them.<br> <br>What do we do now?<br> <br>No money. That was maybe the biggest problem, after the fact of the men in the green car. You couldn&#x2019;t do anything with no money in New York. People with no money disappeared in New York; they dropped into the sidewalks, never to be seen again.<br> <br>He looked back over his shoulder, saw the green car was a little closer, and the sweat began to run down his back and his arms a little faster. If they knew as much as he suspected they did&#x2014;if they knew how little of the push he actually had left&#x2014;they might try to take him right here and now. Never mind all the people, either. In New York, if it&#x2019;s not happening to you, you develop this funny blindness. Have they been charting me? Andy wondered desperately. If they have, they know, and it&#x2019;s all over but the shouting. If they had, they knew the pattern. After Andy got some money, the strange things stopped happening for a while. The things they were interested in.<br> <br>Keep walking.<br> <br>Sho, boss. Yassuh, boss. Where?<br> <br>He had gone into the bank at noon because his radar had been alerted&#x2014;that funny hunch that they were getting close again. There was money in the bank, and he and Charlie could run on it if they had to. And wasn&#x2019;t that funny? Andrew McGee no longer had an account at the Chemical Allied Bank of New York, not personal checking, not business checking, not savings. They had all disappeared into thin air, and that was when he knew they really meant to bring the hammer down this time. Had all of that really been only five and a half hours ago?<br> <br>But maybe there was a tickle left. Just one little tickle. It had been nearly a week since the last time&#x2014;that presuicidal man at Confidence Associates who had come to the regular Thursday-night counseling session and then begun to talk with an eerie calmness about how Hemingway had committed suicide. And on the way out, his arm casually around the presuicidal man&#x2019;s shoulders, Andy had given him a push. Now, bitterly, he hoped it had been worth it. Because it looked very much as if he and Charlie were going to be the ones to pay. He almost hoped an echo&#x2014;<br> <br>But no. He pushed that away, horrified and disgusted with himself. That was nothing to wish on anybody.<br> <br>One little tickle, he prayed. That&#x2019;s all, God, just one little tickle. Enough to get me and Charlie out of this jam.<br> <br>And oh God, how you&#x2019;ll pay&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. plus the fact that you&#x2019;ll be dead for a month afterward, just like a radio with a blown tube. Maybe six weeks. Or maybe really dead, with your worthless brains leaking out your ears. What would happen to Charlie then?<br> <br>They were coming up on Seventieth Street and the light was against them. Traffic was pouring across and pedestrians were building up at the corner in a bottleneck. And suddenly he knew this was where the men in the green car would take them. Alive if they could, of course, but if it looked like trouble&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, they had probably been briefed on Charlie, too.<br> <br>Maybe they don&#x2019;t even want us alive anymore. Maybe they&#x2019;ve decided just to maintain the status quo. What do you do with a faulty equation? Erase it from the board.<br> <br>A knife in the back, a silenced pistol, quite possibly something more arcane&#x2014;a drop of rare poison on the end of a needle. Convulsions at the corner of Third and Seventieth. Officer, this man appears to have suffered a heart attack.<br> <br>He would have to try for that tickle. There was just nothing else.<br> <br>They reached the waiting pedestrians at the corner. Across the way, DON&#x2019;T WALK held steady and seemingly eternal. He looked back. The green car had stopped. The curbside doors opened and two men in business suits got out. They were young and smooth-cheeked. They looked considerably fresher than Andy McGee felt.<br> <br>He began elbowing his way through the clog of pedestrians, eyes searching frantically for a vacant cab.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, man&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;For Christ&#x2019; sake, fella!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Please, mister, you&#x2019;re stepping on my dog&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Excuse me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. excuse me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Andy said desperately. He searched for a cab. There were none. At any other time the street would have been stuffed with them. He could feel the men from the green car coming for them, wanting to lay hands on him and Charlie, to take them with them God knew where, the Shop, some damn place, or do something even worse&#x2014;<br> <br>Charlie laid her head on his shoulder and yawned.<br> <br>Andy saw a vacant cab.<br> <br>&#x201c;Taxi! Taxi!&#x201d; he yelled, flagging madly with his free hand.<br> <br>Behind him, the two men dropped all pretense and ran.<br> <br>The taxi pulled over.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hold it!&#x201d; one of the men yelled. &#x201c;Police! Police!&#x201d;<br> <br>A woman near the back of the crowd at the corner screamed, and then they all began to scatter.<br> <br>Andy opened the cab&#x2019;s back door and handed Charlie in. He dived in after her. &#x201c;La Guardia, step on it,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hold it, cabby. Police!&#x201d;<br> <br>The cab driver turned his head toward the voice and Andy pushed&#x2014;very gently. A dagger of pain was planted squarely in the center of Andy&#x2019;s forehead and then quickly withdrawn, leaving a vague locus of pain, like a morning headache&#x2014;the kind you get from sleeping on your neck.<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re after that black guy in the checkered cap, I think,&#x201d; he said to the cabby.<br> <br>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; the driver said, and pulled serenely away from the curb. They moved down East Seventieth.<br> <br>Andy looked back. The two men were standing alone at the curb. The rest of the pedestrians wanted nothing to do with them. One of the men took a walkie-talkie from his belt and began to speak into it. Then they were gone.<br> <br>&#x201c;That black guy,&#x201d; the driver said, &#x201c;whadde do? Rob a liquor store or somethin, you think?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Andy said, trying to think how to go on with this, how to get the most out of this cab driver for the least push. Had they got the cab&#x2019;s plate number? He would have to assume they had. But they wouldn&#x2019;t want to go to the city or state cops, and they would be surprised and scrambling, for a while at least<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re all a bunch of junkies, the blacks in this city,&#x201d; the driver said. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t tell me, I&#x2019;ll tell you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Charlie was going to sleep. Andy took off his corduroy jacket, folded it, and slipped it under her head. He had begun to feel a thin hope. If he could play this right, it might work. Lady Luck had sent him what Andy thought of (with no prejudice at all) as a pushover. He was the sort that seemed the easiest to push, right down the line: he was white (Orientals were the toughest, for some reason); he was quite young (old people were nearly impossible) and of medium intelligence (bright people were the easiest pushes, stupid ones harder, and with the mentally retarded it was impossible).<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve changed my mind,&#x201d; Andy said. &#x201c;Take us to Albany, please.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Where?&#x201d; The driver stared at him in the rearview mirror. &#x201c;Man, I can&#x2019;t take a fare to Albany, you out of your mind?&#x201d;<br> <br>Andy pulled his wallet, which contained a single dollar bill. He thanked God that this was not one of those cabs with a bulletproof partition and no way to contact the driver except through a money slot. Open contact always made it easier to push. He had been unable to figure out if that was a psychological thing or not, and right now it was immaterial.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to give you a five-hundred-dollar bill,&#x201d; Andy said quietly, &#x201c;to take me and my daughter to Albany. Okay?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Jeee-sus, mister&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Andy stuck the bill into the cabby&#x2019;s hand, and as the cabby looked down at it, Andy pushed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and pushed hard. For a terrible second he was afraid it wasn&#x2019;t going to work, that there was simply nothing left, that he had scraped the bottom of the barrel when he had made the driver see the nonexistent black man in the checkered cab.<br> <br>Then the feeling came&#x2014;as always accompanied by that steel dagger of pain. At the same moment, his stomach seemed to take on weight and his bowels locked in sick, gripping agony. He put an unsteady hand to his face and wondered if he was going to throw up&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or die. For that one moment he wanted to die, as he always did when he overused it&#x2014;use it, don&#x2019;t abuse it, the sign-off slogan of some long-ago disc jockey echoing sickly in his mind&#x2014;whatever &#x201c;it&#x201d; was. If at that very moment someone had slipped a gun into his hand&#x2014;<br> <br>Then he looked sideways at Charlie, Charlie sleeping, Charlie trusting him to get them out of this mess as he had all the others, Charlie confident he would be there when she woke up. Yes, all the messes, except it was all the same mess, the same fucking mess, and all they were doing was running again. Black despair pressed behind his eyes.<br> <br>The feeling passed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but not the headache. The headache would get worse and worse until it was a smashing weight, sending red pain through his head and neck with every pulsebeat. Bright lights would make his eyes water helplessly and send darts of agony into the flesh just behind his eyes. His sinuses would close and he would have to breathe through his mouth. Drill bits in his temples. Small noises magnified, ordinary noises as loud as jackhammers, loud noises insupportable. The headache would worsen until it felt as if his head were being crushed inside an inquisitor&#x2019;s lovecap. Then it would even off at that level for six hours, or eight, or maybe ten. This time he didn&#x2019;t know. He had never pushed it so far when he was so close to drained. For whatever length of time he was in the grip of the headache, he would be next to helpless. Charlie would have to take care of him. God knew she had done it before&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but they had been lucky. How many times could you be lucky?<br> <br>&#x201c;Gee, mister, I don&#x2019;t know&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Which meant he thought it was law trouble.<br> <br>&#x201c;The deal only goes as long as you don&#x2019;t mention it to my little girl,&#x201d; Andy said. &#x201c;The last two weeks she&#x2019;s been with me. Has to be back with her mother tomorrow morning.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Visitation rights,&#x201d; the cabby said. &#x201c;I know all about it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You see, I was supposed to fly her up.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;To Albany? Probably Ozark, am I right?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Right. Now, the thing is, I&#x2019;m scared to death of flying. I know how crazy that sounds, but it&#x2019;s true. Usually I drive her back up, but this time my ex-wife started in on me, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; In truth, Andy didn&#x2019;t. He had made up the story on the spur of the moment and now it seemed to be headed straight down a blind alley. Most of it was pure exhaustion.<br> <br>&#x201c;So I drop you at the old Albany airport, and as far as Moms knows, you flew, right?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d; His head was thudding.<br> <br>&#x201c;Also, so far as Moms knows, you&#x2019;re no plucka-plucka-plucka, am I four oh?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; Plucka-plucka-plucka? What was that supposed to mean? The pain was getting bad.<br> <br>&#x201c;Five hundred bucks to skip a plane ride,&#x201d; the driver mused.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s worth it to me,&#x201d; Andy said, and gave one last little shove. In a very quiet voice, speaking almost into the cabby&#x2019;s ear, he added, &#x201c;And it ought to be worth it to you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Listen,&#x201d; the driver said in a dreamy voice. &#x201c;I ain&#x2019;t turning down no five hundred dollars. Don&#x2019;t tell me, I&#x2019;ll tell you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Andy said, and settled back. The cab driver was satisfied. He wasn&#x2019;t wondering about Andy&#x2019;s half-baked story. He wasn&#x2019;t wondering what a seven-year-old girl was doing visiting her father for two weeks in October with school in. He wasn&#x2019;t wondering about the fact that neither of them had so much as an overnight bag. He wasn&#x2019;t worried about anything. He had been pushed.<br> <br>Now Andy would go ahead and pay the price.<br> <br>He put a hand on Charlie&#x2019;s leg. She was fast asleep. They had been on the go all afternoon&#x2014;ever since Andy got to her school and pulled her out of her second-grade class with some half-remembered excuse&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. grandmother&#x2019;s very ill&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. called home&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. sorry to have to take her in the middle of the day. And beneath all that a great, swelling relief. How he had dreaded looking into Mrs. Mishkin&#x2019;s room and seeing Charlie&#x2019;s seat empty, her books stacked neatly inside her desk: No, Mr. McGee&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. she went with your friends about two hours ago&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they had a note from you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. wasn&#x2019;t that all right? Memories of Vicky coming back, the sudden terror of the empty house that day. His crazy chase after Charlie. Because they had had her once before, oh yes.<br> <br>But Charlie had been there. How close had it been? Had he beaten them by half an hour? Fifteen minutes? Less? He didn&#x2019;t like to think about it. He had got them a late lunch at Nathan&#x2019;s and they had spent the rest of the afternoon just going&#x2014;Andy could admit to himself now that he had been in a state of blind panic&#x2014;riding subways, buses, but mostly just walking. And now she was worn out.<br> <br>He spared her a long, loving look. Her hair was shoulder length, perfect blond, and in her sleep she had a calm beauty. She looked so much like Vicky that it hurt. He closed his own eyes.<br> <br>In the front seat, the cab driver looked wonderingly at the five-hundred-dollar bill the guy had handed him. He tucked it away in the special belt pocket where he kept all of his tips. He didn&#x2019;t think it was strange that this fellow in the back had been walking around New York with a little girl and a five-hundred-dollar bill in his pocket.

Pope John Paul II calls the late theologian Soloviev (1853-1900) one of the modern era&#39;s great &#34;witnesses of the faith and illustrious Christian thinkers.&#34; Like the Holy Father, Soloviev was committed to the cause of Christian unity, and spent many years attempting to convince his Orthodox brethren to reunite with Rome under the pope. He even had an audience with Pope Leo XIII in 1888 and received a papal benediction in recognition of his efforts. However, Soloviev was condemned by his own Russian Orthodox church for his efforts and was ordered by the Russian government to cease all public activities. It was then that he wrote his great work, &#34;Russia and the Universal Church,&#34; which combined a brilliant defense of the papacy with a plea for reunification of the Catholic and Orthodox Churches. Unfortunately, the book has been out of print for decades. &#34;The Russian Church and the Papacy&#34; is an abridgment of Soloviev&#39;s classic work, edited by Fr. Ray Ryland. It is a fascinating combination of history, philosophy, and apologetics. When you put down your copy, you&#39;ll have a better, deeper understanding of why Christ instituted the papacy--and you&#39;ll be able to defend the institution like never before.</p><p></p><h2>Divine Beauty : The Invisible Embrace</h2><p>In this eagerly awaited follow-up to his international bestsellers ANAM CARA and ETERNAL ECHOES, John O&#39;Donohue turns his attention to the subject of beauty - the divine beauty that calls the imagination and awakens all that is noble in the human heart. In these uncertain times of global conflict and crisis, we are riven with anxiety; our trust in the future has lost its innocence, for we know now that anything can happen from one second to the next. In such an unsheltered world, it may sound naive to suggest that this might be the moment to invoke and awaken beauty, yet this is exactly the claim that this book seeks to explore. DIVINE BEAUTY is a gentle but urgent call to awaken. As O&#39;Donohue opens our eyes, hearts and minds to the wonder of our own relationship with beauty. Rather than &#39;covering&#39; this theme, he uncovers it, exposing the infinity and mystery of its breadth. His words return us home to the dignity of silence, the profundity of stillness, the power of thought and perception, and the eternal grace and generosity of beauty&#39;s presence. In this masterful and revelatory work, O&#39;Donohue encourages our greater intimacy with beauty, and celebrates it for what it really is: a homecoming of the human spirit. As he focuses on the classical, medieval and Celtic traditions, on art, music, literature, nature and language, O&#39;Donohue reveals how beauty&#39;s invisible embrace invites us towards new heights of passion and creativity. DIVINE BEAUTY is an exquisite treasury of Forms of the Beautiful. Its surface employs narrative, image, anecdote and myth, while into the silence of its subtext are sown seeds of reflection that gradually blossom in the heart. -In this eagerly awaited follow-up to his international bestsellers ANAM CARA and ETERNAL ECHOES, John O&#39;Donohue turns his attention to the subject of beauty - the divine beauty that calls the imagination and awakens all that is noble in the human heart.

Its surface employs narrative, image, anecdote and myth, while into the silence of its subtext are sown seeds of reflection that gradually blossom in the heart.</p><p>&#34;When we awaken to the call of beauty, we become aware of new ways of being in the world,&#34; teaches John O&#39;Donohue. The beautiful unites your feelings, your thoughts, and your dreams--it brings together all the different dimensions of your life. On Beauty: The Invisible Embrace, O&#39;Donohue inducts listeners into this eternal world that lies beyond form and function. &#34;The human soul is always hungry for beauty. It can be sought everywhere: in landscape, furniture, clothes, love, religion ... and in ourselves,&#34; he explains. Perhaps now, more than ever before, is the time to awaken and invoke beauty. There is a great coarseness in our time; it can be seen in our language, in the way we hold life, and in the way that we behave toward each other. Beauty: The Invisible Embrace offers listeners the opportunity to truly experience the beautiful, which--according to this Irish author, poet, and scholar--is to experience unity with the Divine. Drawing from his own Celtic wisdom and the writings of Keats, Rilke, Thomas Aquinas, and others, John O&#39;Donohue guides listeners through five hours of poetry, vision, and imagination to attune to &#34;that which shows us the surprise at the heart of everything.&#34;John O&#39;Donohue was awarded a Ph.D. in philosophical theology from the University of Tnbingen in 1990. He is the author of several works, including a collection of poems, Echoes of Memory, a book on the philosophy of Hegel, Person als Vermittlung, Conamara Blues, and the international bestsellers, Anam Cara and Eternal Echoes. He travels widely in Europe and the US, where he lectures and holds workshops. He lives in Ireland.</p><h2>Every Day Deserves a Chance: Wake Up to the Gift of 24 Hours</h2><p>A leading inspirational author invites individuals to give every day a chance, offering them a delightful formula for upgrading each day to blue ribbon status by saturating their day in Jesus&#39;s grace, entrusting their day to His oversight, and accepting His direction.</p><p><b>Max Lucado</b>, minister for the Oak Hills Church in San Antonio, Texas, is the husband of Denalyn and father of Jenna, Andrea, and Sara. He is the author of multiple bestsellers and is America's leading inspirational author.Beloved Christian author Lucado (<i>Traveling Light</i>), whose books have sold over 55 million copies, follows the psalmist by encouraging readers to "rejoice and be glad" every day. Lucado does mean <i>every</i> day&#x2014;even the day you get fired, or the day you learn your husband is having an affair. Since God is in charge, even lousy days are opportunities to grow, serve and find joy. Lucado provides a formula for this tall task: "Grace. Oversight. Direction," easily remembered by the unsubtle acronym G-O-D. The first step to rejoicing each morning is to drench your day in Jesus' grace, remembering that Jesus has forgiven you for whatever mistakes you made yesterday. Next, seek God's oversight and provision in all that you do. Finally, if you "want to blow the cloud cover off your gray day," embrace the direction God offers you. To illustrate these three principles, Lucado draws on biblical stories and contemporary unsung heroes of the faith: a Christian lawyer who oversees an orphanage in Beijing, for instance. "Daylifters"&#x2014;page-long reflections on Scripture&#x2014;conclude each chapter, and a study guide (not seen by <i>PW</i>) fills out this inspiring, if anodyne, book. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Tour.</p><p>Edward Said makes one of the strongest cases ever for the aphorism, "the pen is mightier than the sword." This is a brilliant work of literary criticism that essentially becomes political science. <i>Culture and Imperialism</i> demonstrates that Western imperialism's most effective tools for dominating other cultures have been literary in nature as much as political and economic. He traces the themes of 19th- and 20th-century Western fiction and contemporary mass media as weapons of conquest and also brilliantly analyzes the rise of oppositional indigenous voices in the literatures of the "colonies." Said would argue that it's no mere coincidence that it was a Victorian Englishman, Edward G. Bulwer-Lytton, who coined the phrase "the pen is mightier . . ." Very highly recommended for anyone who wants to understand how cultures are dominated by words, as well as how cultures can be liberated by resuscitating old voices or creating new voices for new times.&#34;In Culture and Imperialism, Edward Said&#39;s immense erudition and interpretive audacity are brought to bear on a variety of literatures, reanimating the terms of his title and discovering, in the process, how some of the most revered cultural productions call upon the same energies that go into the building of empires. His new book will likely become a classic of contemporary criticism.&#34; --Richard Poirier</p><h2>Storm In A Teacup</h2><p>Storm in a Teacup<br>BBC<br></p><p>Helen Czerski was born in Manchester.

I want it! I want it!&#x201d; pleaded her daughter Charlotte, her cute curly red hair bouncing to emphasize the seriousness of her request. A color has never matched a personality as much as bright pink matched Charlotte&#x2019;s. She had pink everything, including a pink dresser, and even slept in a big, pink four-poster bed. For the precocious six-year-old, pink wasn&#x2019;t just a color, it was a way of life.<br> <br>JoAnne wasn&#x2019;t having it. The outfit had been bought specifically for the holidays and was the one thing Charlotte couldn&#x2019;t wear today, she argued. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll just have to pick out something else,&#x201d; JoAnne resolutely told her daughter.<br> <br>But Charlotte would not be denied. The back-and-forth continued unabated for several minutes with neither party budging until finally JoAnne, sensing she was outmatched by her daughter&#x2019;s impressive powers of persuasion, realized the inevitability of the outcome: Charlotte walked out the door wearing the pink dress, white boots, and a large grin plastered across her face.<br> <br>There were no arguments over what to wear at the home of six-year-old Jesse Lewis; Friday morning meant breakfast at the Misty Vale Deli where, at around 8&nbsp;A.M., Jesse ordered his favorite breakfast sandwich&#x2014;sausage, egg, and cheese&#x2014;and a cup of hot chocolate before school. It had been a late night. Jesse had stayed up to go Christmas shopping with his father, Neil Heslin, buying gifts for friends, family members, and his beloved first-grade teacher, Victoria Soto.<br> <br>The father and son began their evening of shopping at Stew Leonard&#x2019;s grocery in nearby Danbury. Jesse had $37 in his pocket, money he had earned by helping his father set bathroom tiles and fix their 1948 Ford tractor in hopes of having it ready for the next Newtown Labor Day parade so they could throw candy from the back. After carefully surveying the aisles, Jesse decided to use his money to buy Christmas ornaments. He picked out an ornament that had the word &#x201c;Mom&#x201d; on it for his mother, Scarlett, and a similar one that said &#x201c;Brother&#x201d; for his sibling, J.T. He then picked out two for his first-grade teacher, one a star-shaped ornament that read &#x201c;Teacher&#x201d; and the other in the shape of an apple.<br> <br>&#x201c;He put thought into it and was proud of the gifts he picked out,&#x201d; Neil later recalled.<br> <br>The next destination was Walmart, where Jesse walked among the rows of toys to show his father the different gifts he hoped would be waiting for him on Christmas morning. He pointed at the Nerf guns, action figures, toy soldiers, and anything that had to do with the military.<br> <br>The following morning, after finishing up his egg sandwich at the deli and before getting out of the car in front of Sandy Hook Elementary, Jesse turned and embraced his dad, saying, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s going to be all right. Everything&#x2019;s going to be okay, Dad.&#x201d;<br> <br>Neil didn&#x2019;t think much of it at the time. Just Jesse being sweet, he figured. Besides, they would see each other soon enough, Neil thought. They had plans to make gingerbread houses together later that day in school.<br> <br>That Friday at the Barden household seven-year-old Daniel had some extra time before heading off to first grade. He had woken up especially early and had already played a quick game of foosball and devoured a bowl of oatmeal, so his father, Mark, decided it would be a good time to teach his son how to play &#x201c;Jingle Bells&#x201d; on the piano.<br> <br>Mark Barden, a professional musician, sat close to his son on the bench and looked down at the small fingers as they pressed down on the keys.<br> <br>The family was excited about the holidays and Daniel had already written his letter to Santa. Instead of asking for toys, Daniel just wanted to meet the big guy and his reindeer. &#x201c;Dear Santa, I just hope you can let me see you with your reindeer. Merry Christmas. Please write back,&#x201d; he wrote in black marker. &#x201c;I love you. Love Daniel.&#x201d;<br> <br>The Bardens, like so many of their neighbors, were drawn to Newtown by the sterling reputation of the schools. They moved to town in December 2007, when Daniel was two years old, and older siblings James and Natalie were seven and five. The kids were in three different schools with three different bus schedules, which made getting everyone to the right school at the right time a challenge at times. Daniel&#x2019;s pickup time was the latest and he typically slept in while Mark walked his oldest son down the road for a 6:30 A.M. pickup.<br> <br>But on this morning, as Mark and James made their way down the driveway in the dark, they heard the pitter-patter of little footsteps behind them. They turned around and there was Daniel, in his pajamas and flip-flops, awake before dawn to kiss his older brother good-bye. It was the first time in the three months since school had started that Daniel had woken up to say good-bye.<br> <br>On the other side of town, another Sandy Hook family was busy preparing for the school day and, more important, the big party. Tomorrow was December&nbsp;15, the day Josephine Gay would be celebrating her seventh birthday. Josephine, or &#x201c;Joey Bear&#x201d; as her dad liked to call her, loved to swim, so the family was busy planning an indoor pool party with all of her classmates. They had already made the cupcakes with icing in her favorite color, purple, and all of her friends had signed a special birthday T-shirt for her to wear at the party.<br> <br>Joey&#x2019;s classmate Emilie Parker couldn&#x2019;t wait for the party either. The thoughtful six-year-old had found a very special present for her friend. Although Joey couldn&#x2019;t talk, suffering from autism and severe apraxia, her larger-than-life personality was readily apparent to Emilie, who refused to be satisfied with anything short of the perfect gift.<br> <br>So Emilie&#x2019;s mother, Alissa, took her daughter to a local toy store where she roamed the aisles for thirty minutes. Desperation in her eyes, she looked up at her mom and said: &#x201c;I just don&#x2019;t know which one to pick! It is so hard!&#x201d;<br> <br>Moments later Emilie returned with a Belle Barbie doll dressed as a ballerina. &#x201c;Joey loves Barbies and she loves tutus. Joey can&#x2019;t talk, Mom. But she always touches my fluffy skirts and my Barbie backpack, so I just know she will love this!&#x201d;<br> <br>At home, Emilie put the gift for Joey in her closet, exclaiming, &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t wait till Saturday!&#x201d; She couldn&#x2019;t have been more pleased with her find. Inherent in her personality was the ability to make the most mundane tasks joyful, even when life turned stressful.<br> <br>When the Parker family had moved to Newtown eight months earlier, they were still grieving over the loss of Emilie&#x2019;s grandfather, who had passed away that October. At the funeral, Emilie, a budding artist who carried her markers and pencils everywhere, slipped a card she had drawn into his casket. Making cards was something she frequently did to lift the spirits of others.<br> <br>&#x201c;She never missed an opportunity to draw a picture or make a card for those around her,&#x201d; her father, Robbie, recalled.<br> <br>The Parker household was a place of love, affection, and constant learning. That December morning, Robbie had been teaching Emilie Portuguese before he left for work. Just before he walked out the door, Emilie looked at him and said &#x201c;I love you&#x201d; in Portuguese before giving him a kiss good-bye.<br> <br>With Christmas only eleven days away, many children had already caught the Santa bug. And Jessica Rekos&#x2019;s Christmas wish list focused on one thing: horses. The six-year-old loved everything about the animal. She had been taking riding lessons at Kings Bridge Farm in Newtown and devoted all her free time to watching horse movies, reading horse books, drawing horses, and writing stories about her favorite animal. Her parents had even promised that she could have a horse of her own when she turned ten. This year she was hoping to find a pair of cowgirl boots and a black cowgirl hat under the tree.<br> <br>They had to be &#x201c;real cowgirl boots, not ones from Target,&#x201d; her mother, Krista, later recalled. With her hair in a ponytail and her favorite black glittery Uggs on her feet, Jessica marched off to school that morning not knowing that her parents had already fulfilled her Christmas wish and purchased her a pair of the prized boots.<br> <br>Not every child was focused on Christmas: Benjamin Wheeler was focused on his future ambitions. Before leaving for school, the six-year-old wanted to convey an important message to his mother about his future: &#x201c;I still want to be an architect, but I also want to be a paleontologist, because that&#x2019;s what Nate is going to be and I want to do everything Nate does,&#x201d; Benjamin said, referring to the older brother he idolized.<br> <br>That Friday started out as equally happy and normal for so many other animated six-year-olds. The bright yellow buses crisscrossed through the narrow winding streets picking up students throughout the community on their way to Sandy Hook Elementary: James Mattioli, Ana Marquez-Greene, Catherine Hubbard, Noah Pozner, Jack Pinto, Allison Wyatt, and Chase Kowalski. Chase, a budding triathlete, came from his room wearing a green long-sleeved shirt, black sweatpants with a gray stripe, and black L.L. Bean shoes; his mother looked her mismatched son up and down before complimenting her &#x201c;funny little guy&#x2019;s&#x201d; sense of style. &#x201c;Hmm, nice outfit,&#x201d; she told him.<br> <br>The shy and tiny Madeleine Hsu, who always wore colorful flower-print dresses, and Caroline Previdi, an outgoing girl with beautiful green eyes, said their good-byes then hopped on the bus. Grace McDonnell skipped to the bus stop, unable to contain her excitement about getting to school. She always waited at the meeting point with her mom, Lynn, and the two of them would blow kisses to each other as the bus pulled away. That Friday morning, Grace added a pouty face for effect.<br> <br>Dylan Hockley loved to run to the stop, too, playing tag with his neighbors along the way. Before the bus pulled up, he kissed his mother, Nicole, good-bye. Avielle Richman also waved good-bye to her parents after boarding the bus. Her mom, Jennifer, was standing on the porch and her dad, Jeremy, was in the driveway. Avielle flashed her gigantic grin as the driver pulled away.<br> <br>And there was no suppressing Olivia Engel&#x2019;s joy either as the hours counted down to one of the final weekends before Christmas. After school, Olivia, who was active in her church&#x2019;s CCD musical program, was going to make her stage debut in the live nativity at St. Rose of Lima Roman Catholic Church in Newtown.<br> <br>Olivia was going to play an angel.</p><h2>Katherine of Aragon, The True Queen: A Novel (Six Tudor Queens)</h2><p>Bestselling author and acclaimed historian Alison Weir takes on what no fiction writer has done before: creating a dramatic six-book series in which each novel covers one of King Henry VIII&#x2019;s wives. In this captivating opening volume, Weir&nbsp;brings to life the tumultuous tale of Katherine of Aragon, Henry&#x2019;s first, devoted, and &#x201c;true&#x201d; queen.<br> &nbsp;<br> A princess of Spain, Catalina is only sixteen years old when she sets foot on the shores of England. The youngest daughter of the powerful monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella, Catalina is a coveted prize for a royal marriage&#x2014;and Arthur, Prince of Wales, and heir to the English throne, has won her hand. But tragedy strikes and Catalina, now Princess Katherine, is betrothed to the future Henry VIII. She must wait for his coming-of-age, an ordeal that tests her resolve, casts doubt on her trusted confidantes, and turns her into a virtual prisoner.<br> &nbsp;<br> Katherine&#x2019;s patience is rewarded when she becomes Queen of England. The affection between Katherine and Henry is genuine, but forces beyond her control threaten to rend her marriage, and indeed the nation, apart. Henry has fallen under the spell of Katherine&#x2019;s maid of honor, Anne Boleyn. Now Katherine must be prepared to fight, to the end if God wills it, for her faith, her legitimacy, and her heart.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Katherine of Aragon, The True Queen</i></b><br> <b>&nbsp;<br></b>&#x201c;Alison Weir starts off her fictional series about the wives of Henry VIII with a nuanced portrayal of Katherine of Aragon.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>The Christian Science Monitor</i></b><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;Weir is excellent on the little details that bring a world to life.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2014;The Guardian</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;As always, Weir demonstrates a keen eye for crafting dramatic scenes of beautiful, accurate detail, instilling in the reader a vivid sense of being there. . . .

Standing at the balustrade of the deck, high above the stern of the ship, with tendrils of red-�gold hair whipping about her face, Catalina could see green and brown hills and the spires of churches, with houses huddled together beside them; and, at a dizzying distance below, between the land and the rolling vessel, the gray, churning sea. How different it all looked from La Coru�a, with its warm blue waters and its mighty Tower of Hercules, or the dramatic wide sweep of the bay of Laredo! Everything was going to be different from now on.<br><br>Her maid of honor and dear friend, Maria de Salinas, was standing beside her.<br><br>&#x201c;It cannot be long now till we come into port,&#x201d; Catalina said. &#x201c;When I think how many years I have dreamed of coming to England, I cannot quite believe I am nearly there. I thank God that you are with me, Maria. I would not want to face this alone.&#x201d; There was no one else to whom she would have admitted that.<br><br>&#x201c;And I am glad of your Highness being with me,&#x201d; Maria replied. She was two years older than Catalina, and they had been friends all their lives. It was typical of Maria to have pulled off her cap and let her rippling long night-�black hair blow free in the wind. She was almost dancing with anticipation, her large eyes luminous as she gazed at the land ahead. Catalina reminded herself that Maria was also going into the unknown. It was expected that she and the other young ladies in attendance on their Infanta would be found well�born husbands in England. But where Catalina was facing the future with a certain trepidation, Maria could barely contain her excitement.<br><br>&#x201c;Soon I will come face-�to-�face with Prince Arthur,&#x201d; Catalina said. She had been told countless times that her betrothed was a golden prince, beautiful and graceful, with many excellent qualities, and that the English people hailed him as their great hope for the future. &#x201c;I pray that I may please him.&#x201d; And that all will be well.<br><br>&#x201c;Judging by his letters, he is as eager to meet your Highness as you are to see him. You are lucky to have a husband who loves you.&#x201d; Maria smiled encouragingly&#x2014;�and not a little enviously.<br><br>&#x201c;But how can he love me when he has never met me?&#x201d; Catalina asked, voicing a concern she had kept to herself for a long time. &#x201c;Was he that much taken by my portrait?&#x201d; Master Miguel, her mother&#x2019;s court painter, had taken an excellent likeness.<br><br>&#x201c;He could hardly have failed!&#x201d; Maria said. &#x201c;You are so pretty.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He is just fifteen!&#x201d; Catalina retorted. &#x201c;He is nearly a year younger than I am. I think he has been told what to write, just as I was. And&#x2014;�&#x201d; She bit her lip. &#x201c;&#x2014;�I fear he is young for his years. Remember how my coming was postponed for a year until he was ready to be married, and then it was postponed again?&#x201d; That had been a strange business, veiled in secrecy. Not even to Maria would Catalina confide her secret suspicions that all might not be quite well with Arthur&#x2014;�and that some dreadful deed had finally made her coming to England possible. It was as if saying the suspicions out loud would confirm them. &#x201c;At least it gave me time to learn French!&#x201d; she said brightly. King Henry&#x2019;s queen and his mother, the Lady Margaret, had specially requested it, as they spoke no Spanish or Latin. And they had urged her to cultivate a taste for wine, as the water in England was undrinkable. She had duly complied. She had expected many such requests and instructions to prepare her for her life in England, but there had been just one more, one that had immeasurably troubled her.<br><br>&#x201c;King Henry wants me to forget Spain,&#x201d; Catalina revealed. &#x201c;He thinks I will be happier not remembering it. Dr. de Puebla wrote that to the King my father.&#x201d; Dr. de Puebla was Spain&#x2019;s resident ambassador in England, and it was he who had negotiated her marriage.<br><br>&#x201c;King Henry means well, I am sure, Highness,&#x201d; Maria soothed.<br><br>&#x201c;I can never forget my homeland,&#x201d; Catalina declared, tears welling as visions of the land of her birth came to mind, &#x201c;but I am determined to be a good Englishwoman.&#x201d; She blinked the tears away.<br><br>&#x201c;We must make ready,&#x201d; she said. And then, mimicking her duenna, &#x201c;I must always remember that as soon as I set foot on English soil, I am no longer the Infanta Catalina but the Lady Katherine, Princess of Wales!&#x201d; Catalina had been told that her name must be anglicized to please her husband&#x2019;s future subjects, for one day, when King Henry died and Prince Arthur succeeded to the throne, she would be Queen of England.<br><br>Maria laughed&#x2014;�Catalina had Do�a Elvira to the life! Catalina smiled, but as she went ahead of Maria down the steep stairs to the sterncastle, where she and the ladies of her suite had been allocated cabins, she was dutifully resolving to think of herself as Katherine from now on.<br><br>The cabins were cramped and creaking, with barely room for a feather bed, and they were unpleasantly stuffy after four days at sea. Mercifully, it had been a smooth crossing, unlike the earlier one from La Coru�a. It was hard to believe that she had set out on her wedding journey more than five weeks ago, excited at the thought that the long-�awaited new life was about to begin, yet grief-�stricken at leaving her own country and the mother she loved and revered.<br><br>Four days in raging, storm-�tossed seas had made homesickness pale into insignificance beside the fear of drowning and the constant irregular buffeting of the waves. Katherine and her ladies had been horribly, disgustingly sick. All those hours she had intended to devote to improving her English had been spent lying prone, clinging to her wooden cot as the ship bucked and dipped, and praying in terror for the tempest to stop. Her greatest fear had been that the storm was sent by God as punishment for the great sin that had made her marriage possible, and that they would all be drowned. But God, it had seemed, was reserving His vengeance for another day. Never would Katherine forget the relief she felt when the ship&#x2019;s master managed by a miracle to dock at Laredo; and she had been full of devout thanks for the four weeks&#x2019; respite there while they were forced to wait for the seas to calm. She had hated boarding the ship again, dreaded entrusting herself once more to the unpredictable temper of the waters of the Bay of Biscay and the English Channel. Mercifully, they were calm, but she had still been horribly seasick.<br><br>Katherine and Maria found Do�a Elvira in the largest cabin, which Katherine herself occupied. Her duenna came from an old and respected Castilian family and was devoted to Queen Isabella and determined to do her duty by Isabella&#x2019;s daughter. In the absence of Katherine&#x2019;s mother, Do�a Elvira&#x2019;s word was now law in the Infanta&#x2019;s household. She was a stern, proud woman in her late fifties, with a disdainful eye and a sharp tongue, too vigilant for comfort&#x2014;�and too old to remember what it was to be young and bursting with life! And yet, for all her strictness and rigid outlook on life, the Queen trusted her implicitly, and had told Katherine that she must do so too.<br><br>Katherine watched as Do�a Elvira heaved her bulk around the narrow spaces of the cabin and cast a critical eye over the four gowns laid across the bed as well upon the traveling chest, gowns of red and gold damask, woven silk, velvet of the costliest black, cloth of gold. Queen Isabella had commanded that her daughter go to England dressed as befit a future queen, and had paid for a sumptuous trousseau that reflected the glory and majesty of Spain. The chests that lay in the ship&#x2019;s hold were packed with more sumptuous gowns, undergarments edged with fine blackwork lace, hoods of velvet with habiliments of gold, silver, or pearls. There were night robes bordered with lace for summer and fur for winter, cloth stockings and lined kirtles, as well as the stiff, decorous Spanish farthingales that belled out the skirts of Katherine&#x2019;s gowns. Also packed in locked and weighty coffers were the gold and silver plate that was to form part of her dowry and her jewelry. She had exclaimed in amazement when her mother had shown her the intricate bejeweled necklaces, the ornate collars, the gold chains, the crucifixes, and the brooches that had been provided for her.<br><br>Then Queen Isabella had laid across her daughter&#x2019;s outstretched hands a beautifully embroidered christening robe. &#x201c;For your children,&#x201d; she had said. &#x201c;I pray that God blesses you with many fine sons. I hope you will be the source of all kinds of happiness in England.&#x201d;<br><br>Katherine felt like weeping at the memory.<br><br>&#x201c;This one,&#x201d; the duenna said, pointing to the damask, &#x201c;if your Highness approves.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; Katherine agreed. Her mother had instructed that she must trust Do�a Elvira&#x2019;s judgment in all things.<br><br>She stood patiently while three of her maids&#x2014;�Maria de Salinas and the twin sisters Isabel and Blanche de Vargas&#x2014;�stripped her to her farthingale and chemise, dressed her in a kirtle and the rich gown, laced up the back and tied on the wide hanging sleeves. Do�a Elvira herself placed around Katherine&#x2019;s neck the heavy gold collar adorned with gem-�encrusted Ks and pomegranates, the Princess&#x2019;s personal badge.<br><br>&#x201c;The pomegranate stands for fertility,&#x201d; Queen Isabella had said. &#x201c;Your first duty to Prince Arthur will be to bear him sons.&#x201d;<br><br>Katherine was ten when the collar was made, and ensuring the royal succession had been far in the future. But now she wished she knew more about the process of getting sons. Her mother and her duenna had told her that it was a wife&#x2019;s duty to submit to the will of her husband in all things, and that children were born at his pleasure. Her mother, with many references to Scripture, had told her a little about how children were begotten, but there was still much mystery surrounding the whole business. Isabella&#x2019;s obvious embarrassment and the euphemisms she used had left Katherine confused, and showed that decent people did not like to talk about such things. And yet, in a few weeks she would be married, and know the whole truth.<br><br>Do�a Elvira lifted up a length of the finest white lawn, exquisitely hemmed. &#x201c;Her Majesty&#x2019;s command was that your Highness be veiled in public until you are married,&#x201d; she reminded her charge as she combed Katherine&#x2019;s long hair and arranged the veil over her golden head. And so it was that when the Princess emerged on the main deck to see sailors leaping across to the busy quayside to fling stout ropes around the bollards and secure the ship in dock, her view of Plymouth&#x2014;�the crowds gathered to welcome her, the banners gaily flapping in the breeze&#x2014;�was a misty one, glimpsed through the folds of her veil.<br><br>Once the gangplank was in place, her train began disembarking, led in stately fashion by the hero of Granada, the Count de Cabra, who commanded her escort. There followed Katherine&#x2019;s first chamberlain, Don Pedro Manrique, who was Do�a Elvira&#x2019;s husband; the second chamberlain, Juan de Diero; Katherine&#x2019;s chaplain, Alessandro Geraldini; three bishops, and a bevy of ladies, maids, gentlemen, and servants, all tricked out in their finest clothes and liveries. Never let it be said that the Spanish sovereigns, their Most Catholic Majesties King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella, had sent their daughter lacking in any way into England!<br><br>Katherine came last, escorted by Do�a Elvira, whose bulk was resplendent in yards of green damask and black velvet, her gray hair covered by a voluminous hood. After waiting all her life&#x2014;�or so it seemed&#x2014;�for this moment, Katherine could hardly believe that it had arrived. She carried herself with conscious dignity and pride, aware that she was representing her parents and Spain, the greatest power in Christendom. Ahead of her swelled the sound of cheering voices, and when she stepped on land, even though she felt a little giddy after four days in motion on the sea, she knew a sense of triumph tempered with awe. This was the kingdom of which she would one day be Queen. God send that she would be worthy of it, and of the unknown prince, her husband.<br><br>The Mayor of Plymouth and his brethren, resplendent in their furred scarlet robes, were waiting to receive her, bowing low.<br><br>&#x201c;Welcome, your Highness!&#x201d; the mayor boomed. &#x201c;Welcome to En�gland!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I thank you, good sirs,&#x201d; Katherine replied, inclining her head. She had practiced the words on board the ship. Her English was not very good, and it was heavily accented, but she was determined to master it.<br><br>The people were roaring their approval. Some were gaping and pointing at the dark-�skinned Moorish servants in her Spanish retinue, but most were jostling each other to gain a better sight of their new princess. Katherine felt humbled to be the focus of such wild excitement, even though she knew that her father considered the King of England lucky to have a Spanish bride for his son.<br><br>&#x201c;They could not have received your Highness with greater joy had you been the Savior of the world!&#x201d; exclaimed one of Katherine&#x2019;s gentlemen. Do�a Elvira frowned. Men were not supposed to address the Princess familiarly. But even the stern duenna was gratified by her charge&#x2019;s reception.<br><br>&#x201c;His Grace the King sends his greetings, my lady,&#x201d; the mayor said. &#x201c;He looks forward to welcoming you himself in London, with Prince Arthur. But for now, at your pleasure, a great feast awaits your Highness.&#x201d;</p><h2>New Chakra Healing: Activate Your 32 Energy Centers (Llewellyn&#39;s Whole Life Series)</h2><p><i>New Chakra Healing </i>begins where the traditional seven-chakra system leaves off.

A standard reference on the subject.</p><p>Dave Hughes is a highly respected fly-fishing writer with more than two dozen books in print, including <i>Trout from Small Streams: 2nd Edition</i>, <i>Handbook of Hatches: 2nd Edition</i>, and <i>Trout Flies</i>. He lives in Portland, Oregon.The history of fly-fishing begins with wet flies, but in this country wets haven't made much headway against the popularity of dries. One reason is that they often imitate adult insects, which appear mostly on or above the surface of the water; another is that they have been fished wrongly. With three decades of fishing experience and coursework in aquatic entymology, plus leading workshops across the country and writing four books on fly fishing tactics, Hughes (Fly Fishing Basics, Stackpole, 1994) here does what he values in others: instructs and enthuses. He explains subsurface insect behavior, extensively covers fishing literature and history, presents detailed instruction on materials and tying, and teaches presentation-all with numerous photos, drawings, and 24 pages of color plates (not seen by this reviewer). Carefully researched and well written, this volume should be useful to all fly fishers and the libraries serving them.<br><i>Roland Person, Southern Illinois Univ.

It is a journey through myth, magic, and astounding archaeological revelations that forces us to rethink the cultures of our lost ancestors and the origins of civilization.<br><br>The first fully illustrated book by Graham Hancock, <b>Heaven's Mirror</b> is a stunning and illuminating tour of the spirituality of the ancients--a search for a secret recorded in the very foundations of the holiest sites of antiquity.</p><p>It <i>could</i> be true! That's the enthusiasm that author and scholar-mystic Graham Hancock counts on--in himself and in his readers--as he lays down his theories of an ancient (Atlantean, perhaps?) civilization that disseminated a sophisticated religion of ground-sky dualism and a "science" of immortality. Hancock's previous work, including the popular and controversial <i>Fingerprints of the Gods</i>, has drawn criticism for its leaps of faith and allegedly pseudoscientific conclusions, but <i>Heaven's Mirror</i> proves at least a little more substantial. His chief thesis is that numerous ancient sites and monuments--the pyramids of Mexico and Egypt, the ruins of Angkor Wat in Cambodia, the monuments of Yonaguni in the Pacific, and the megaliths of Peru and Bolivia--are situated in such a way, geodetically, that they point towards some separate and uniform influence, some lost civilization or "invisible college" of astronomer-priests. And that civilization, as evidenced in the mathematics and architecture of the sites, points towards some <i>gnosis</i>, or body of knowledge, that would allow humanity to transcend the trap of mortality, a worldview in which the knowledge-giving serpent of Eden is not a villain but a hero.<p> Whatever you think of Hancock's ideas and theoretical musings in archaeo-astronomy, <i>Heaven's Mirror</i> is a gorgeous book, thanks to the photography of Santha Faiia. Lush, evocative photos of the monoliths on Easter Island and temples deep in the Cambodian jungle are enough to set the mind to introspective wandering--maybe, just maybe, Hancock's got it right after all. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>Graham Hancock has traveled around the world writing books and filming movies on archaeological discoveries and their connection to our distant past. He is the author of the best-selling Fingerprints of the Gods, The Sign and the Seal, and The Mars Mystery.<br><br>Santha Faiia is an internationally published photographer specializing in ancient cultures and monuments.

Ministry leaders are eager to mentor others, but find themselves unable to personally meet the needs of the many women wanting to be discipled. The Women of Destiny Bible can help both groups. By combining the collective wisdom of the world's most respected Charismatic women leaders with the full NKJV text, this Bible allows women in leadership to communicate their experiences with God, their struggles and victories, their best advice to other women they look up to, women who are experts in their fields and uniquely qualified to help others "grow up" in God.</p></p><p></p><h2>Love and Responsibility Pope John Paul II A Simplified Version</h2><p>This project has been Approved by the Vatican Secretary of the State <p>In his brilliance, Pope writes in a style which is difficult for the average reader.

But what of the "unforbidden" pleasures?</p><p><i>Unforbidden Pleasures</i> is the singular new book from Adam Phillips, the author of <i>Missing Out</i>, <i>Going Sane</i>, and <i>On Balance</i>.

And we may have underestimated just how restricted our restrictiveness, in thrall to the forbidden and its rules, may make us.

She was an old-school librarian&#x2014;nicknamed the lemon because of her frequently puckered disposition&#x2014;who was in charge of the circulation of materials for the library located on the Connecticut shore.</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry, I tried to stop it but I couldn&#x2019;t hold it in,&#x201d; Beth said. She was wearing a crown and carrying a sparkling scepter, which was really a bejeweled cardboard tube from a roll of wrapping paper with a tissue-paper flower sticking out of the end.</p><p>Lindsey noted the tail pinned to the back of her yoga pants and the pointy ears poking out beneath her crown. With her short, dark hair styled in wild disarray, Beth bore a remarkable resemblance to Max, the character she was representing.</p><p>&#x201c;Where the Wild Things Are for story time?&#x201d; Lindsey guessed.</p><p>&#x201c;Best story time book ever,&#x201d; Beth said.</p><p>&#x201c;Brilliant! I love Maurice Sendak,&#x201d; Paula Turner said.</p><p>&#x201c;No one asked you,&#x201d; Ms. Cole said. Her glance was frosty as she took in her part-time clerk with undisguised suspicion.</p><p>Paula was the library&#x2019;s newly hired clerk, and with her sleeve of colorful arm tattoos and long hair dyed a deep purple, she had been a challenge for the conservative Ms. Cole to supervise from day one.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;ll do, people,&#x201d; Lindsey Norris said. She was the director of the small library and tried to maintain some semblance of order. &#x201c;We have three more loaded book trucks coming in. We need to make room behind the desk.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There is no more room,&#x201d; Ms. Cole said. Her tone was as dry as butterless toast, and if she were anyone else Lindsey might have thought she was teasing. Ms. Cole was not.</p><p>A monochromatic dresser, Ms. Cole was in all black today, as if she were in mourning. Lindsey figured she probably was, given that they were holding their first annual fine amnesty day, which went against everything in which Ms. Cole believed.</p><p>She was a punitive sort who enjoyed using fines and shushing to curb their patrons&#x2019; naughty behavior. Lindsey had been trying to get her to roll with the times for a couple of years now. It was a battle.</p><p>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t we get the crafternoon ladies to help?&#x201d; Beth suggested. She was picking up the books that had fallen off of her cart. Lindsey and Paula helped her. Ms. Cole did not.</p><p>&#x201c;In what way?&#x201d; Lindsey asked. She stacked the books back on the cart.</p><p>&#x201c;They can fine-sort the book trucks that are already checked in, which will make room for the new ones,&#x201d; Beth said. &#x201c;In fact, if we wheel the trucks to the meeting room, we can do that while we discuss our book of the week.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They are not cleared to work in the library,&#x201d; Ms. Cole protested.</p><p>&#x201c;Drastic times,&#x201d; Lindsey said. She looked at Paula and Beth. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s wheel the checked-in carts to the crafternoon room to make room for the incoming.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I really must protest,&#x201d; Ms. Cole said.</p><p>&#x201c;Of course you must,&#x201d; Lindsey said. She met Ms. Cole&#x2019;s upset gaze with her own and tried to channel her inner calm. &#x201c;Answer me this: Do you have a better idea?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You mean aside from never having another fine amnesty day ever again?&#x201d; the lemon asked. &#x201c;No.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then to the crafternoon room it is,&#x201d; Lindsey said.</p><p>She, Beth and Paula each took a cart and pushed it to the back room where the crafternoon ladies met every Thursday afternoon to eat, discuss a book and work on a craft.</p><p>As they entered the room, they found Nancy Peyton and Violet La Rue already in place on the comfy couches placed in the center of the room. Violet had been in charge of the food today, so it was ham and cheese sliders, potato soup and a veggie platter.</p><p>Lindsey felt her stomach rumble. She tried to remember the last time she&#x2019;d eaten. It must have been last night because when she&#x2019;d arrived at the library this morning, the book drop had been full to bursting. She&#x2019;d skipped breakfast to help unload it and hadn&#x2019;t had a chance to think about eating since.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s this?&#x201d; Nancy asked as the parade of carts appeared.</p><p>Nancy was Lindsey&#x2019;s landlord as well as one of her crafternoon buddies. A widow, Nancy had inherited her old captain&#x2019;s house when her husband, Jake, went down with his ship many years ago. Nancy then turned it into a three-family house and rented out the top two floors. Lindsey lived on the third level while Nancy&#x2019;s nephew Charlie Peyton was the filler in their house sandwich and resided on the second floor.</p><p>&#x201c;How married are you to the idea of doing a craft today?&#x201d; Lindsey asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Not very. Why?&#x201d; Violet asked.</p><p>She was dressed in her usual jewel-toned caftan, which made her dark complexion glow. A retired Broadway actress, Violet had an innate grace and flair that, despite her gray hair, which she wore scraped into a tight bun at the back of her head, made her seem eternally youthful. Truly, she could command a room like nobody&#x2019;s business. Right now, her tone was cautious. Smart lady.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m throwing myself on your mercy,&#x201d; Lindsey said. She bowed with her arms out in obeisance just so they would know she was sincere. &#x201c;We are so far behind on sorting the books that have been returned we may never catch up. Would you ladies be willing to help us get these trucks in order?&#x201d;</p><p>Nancy and Violet exchanged a glance. The two ladies were long-time best friends and Lindsey knew they communicated without words. It was no surprise to her when they both faced her and answered at the same time.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, of course,&#x201d; they said together.</p><p>&#x201c;Is Ms. Cole going to come in here and yell at us for eating near the books?&#x201d; Violet asked. &#x201c;Because that would be a problem for me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So long as we don&#x2019;t eat over the books, I think we&#x2019;ll be okay,&#x201d; Lindsey said.</p><p>&#x201c;Food, I need food!&#x201d; Mary Murphy hustled into the room with Charlene La Rue right behind her.</p><p>&#x201c;Girl, every time I see you, you are either eating or napping,&#x201d; Nancy said. &#x201c;Are you feeling all right?&#x201d;</p><p>She moved to stand beside the food table and loaded a plate for Mary before the woman even had her jacket off.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, yeah, I&#x2019;m fine,&#x201d; Mary said. &#x201c;Just storing up for winter, you know, like a squirrel.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s May,&#x201d; Violet said. &#x201c;You keep packing it in like this and you&#x2019;ll be able to hibernate for two winters.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Heh heh.&#x201d; Mary laughed uneasily and her gaze darted to Lindsey.</p><p>Lindsey smiled at her to let her know her secret was still safe. The truth was Mary was pregnant with her first child. Lindsey had figured it out, but the others were still clueless. Lindsey had promised Mary she wouldn&#x2019;t say a word to anyone, including Mary&#x2019;s brother Sully, who Lindsey had an on-and-off-again sort of relationship with, so Mary&#x2019;s news and the fact that Lindsey knew about it and Sully didn&#x2019;t made things a teensy bit complicated.</p><p>Charlene La Rue paused beside her mother, Violet, to kiss her cheek. Charlene had inherited her mother&#x2019;s slender grace and beauty but instead of going into theater, Charlene was a television reporter in New Haven. With the career and the husband and kids her schedule was packed to bursting, but she kept her crafternoon Thursday commitment because it was one of the few times she got to spend with her mother and talk about something besides the children.</p><p>Thankfully, everyone was on board with fine-sorting the books while they discussed their book of the week, Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x2019;s The Scarlet Letter.</p><p>It took three trips to bring all of the extra carts into the crafternoon room, but once they were in, they all took a cart and began arranging the books for shelving.</p><p>&#x201c;Question,&#x201d; Charlene asked. &#x201c;How far do I go following the Dewey number?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Meaning?&#x201d; Beth asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Can I just lump all the 398.2 books together or do I go all the way to the letter that follows?&#x201d; Charlene asked.</p><p>Lindsey glanced at Beth and said, &#x201c;I still believe in 398.2, how about you?&#x201d;</p><p>Beth laughed. Mary and the others frowned.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t get it,&#x201d; Nancy said.</p><p>&#x201c;I do.&#x201d; Charlene glanced up from her cart. &#x201c;Judging by these books, 398.2 is the base number for fairy tales. Won&#x2019;t Sully and Robbie be happy to know that she still believes in happy ever after.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ah, yes, but who will be her Prince Charming?&#x201d; Violet asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, no,&#x201d; Lindsey said. &#x201c;There is no charming anyone for me. Thank you very much.&#x201d;</p><p>She shook her head back and forth to emphasize her point. She&#x2019;d been keeping her personal life on the down low and had no intention of sharing any information until she knew where it was going. &#x201c;We are not discussing my love life or lack thereof, not when we have Beth&#x2019;s new relationship to dissect and discuss.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Way to throw me under the gossip train,&#x201d; Beth said. Then she grinned. &#x201c;But since you asked, Aidan is wonderful. He&#x2019;s funny and smart, handsome and kind.&#x201d; She sighed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never been happier.&#x201d;</p><p>The woman positively glowed and Lindsey was pretty sure her crown sparkled for real. The other ladies all sighed with her and Lindsey was relieved to have successfully distracted them.</p><p>&#x201c;Has the &#x2018;L&#x2019; word been used yet?&#x201d; Mary asked through a mouthful of ham and cheese.</p><p>&#x201c;Not yet,&#x201d; Beth said. She fretted her lower lip between her teeth. &#x201c;Should it have been? We&#x2019;ve been dating for three months. Who says it first? Should I say it first? I don&#x2019;t know if I&#x2019;m ready for that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It should just come naturally,&#x201d; Nancy said.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s right, but I&#x2019;d wait and let him say it first,&#x201d; Charlene said. &#x201c;I knew I was in love with Martin after the first two months, but I let him take the lead on the &#x2018;L&#x2019; word. Men can be pretty skittish about declarations of love.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ian said it first,&#x201d; Mary said. &#x201c;Of course, I didn&#x2019;t really have a chance since he said &#x2018;I love you&#x2019; the very first moment he saw me. I think our meeting went something like me saying, &#x2018;Hi, I&#x2019;m Mary,&#x2019; to which he replied, &#x2018;Yes, I&#x2019;ll marry you. I&#x2019;ve been madly in love with you since you walked through the door five seconds ago.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>Lindsey laughed. She could see Ian doing just that. Mary was a lovely woman with thick curls of red-brown hair and sparkling blue eyes, and Ian was, well, not so much of a looker. But he had personality by the bucketful and he adored his wife, which Mary never took for granted.</p><p>&#x201c;Speaking of the &#x2018;L&#x2019; word and relationships, here&#x2019;s my question about the book,&#x201d; Nancy said. &#x201c;What does a strong female like Hester see in a spineless sniveler like Dimwit?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Dimmesdale,&#x201d; Violet said.</p><p>&#x201c;Whatever,&#x201d; Nancy said. &#x201c;I hated him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I think that was the point. Hawthorne portrays him as weak and Hester as strong even though she&#x2019;s treated very badly for adultery while he hides behind his position and does nothing to protect her,&#x201d; Charlene said. &#x201c;What did you think of him, Mary?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Huh?&#x201d; Mary asked through a mouthful of soup.</p><p>&#x201c;What did you think about Dimmesdale?&#x201d;</p><p>Mary looked chagrinned. &#x201c;No idea. I didn&#x2019;t finish the book. Frankly, when I got to Hawthorne&#x2019;s eighth use of the word ignominy, I quit.&#x201d;</p><p>Beth started to laugh and the others joined in.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m serious. That word does not roll through my head,&#x201d; Mary said. &#x201c;Every time it cropped up, I had to stop and sound it out and it never felt right and then I was just irritated, so I quit.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hawthorne loved that word,&#x201d; Lindsey said. &#x201c;I read a critique where it said he uses ignominy sixteen times in the book, ignominious seven times, and ignominiously once.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ugh.&#x201d; Mary looked pained as she spooned more soup into her mouth.</p><p>The rest of the crafternooners shared amused looks but no one chastised Mary for quitting on the book. They weren&#x2019;t very strict about that part of being a crafternooner, or any part of being a crafternooner for that matter.</p><p>&#x201c;Lindsey, can I talk to you for a second?&#x201d;</p><p>Lindsey turned to see Paula standing in the doorway. She was holding a book in her hands and looked excited.</p><p>&#x201c;Sure, what is it?&#x201d; Lindsey asked as she crossed the room.</p><p>&#x201c;This book,&#x201d; Paula said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s my sure thing. It has to be the winner for the category of most overdue item.&#x201d;</p><p>To keep the staff entertained during the flood of incoming materials, Lindsey had offered up prizes for the staff member who found the most overdue item or the most abused material. The prize was a free pizza because Lindsey had discovered during the past couple of years as director that food was always a motivator for her staff.</p><p>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d; Lindsey took the book and glanced at the cover. It was The Catcher in the Rye and it looked to be in good shape. &#x201c;How overdue is it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Judging by the slip that was left inside the book was due on October twenty-third, nineteen ninety-six.&#x201d; Paula pointed to a yellowed piece of paper. &#x201c;Twenty years.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No way,&#x201d; Lindsey said.</p><p>&#x201c;Way,&#x201d; Paula said. &#x201c;So, I&#x2019;m down for the free pizza from Marco&#x2019;s Pizzeria, right?&#x201d;</p><p>Lindsey pointed to the clock. &#x201c;The contest goes until closing time today, but so far it looks like you&#x2019;re in the lead.&#x201d;</p><p>Paula pumped her fist.</p><p>&#x201c;Did someone say pizza?&#x201d; Mary asked. She had moved from the soup to the veggie platter but her eyes lit up at the word pizza.</p><p>&#x201c;Not for you,&#x201d; Lindsey said. &#x201c;Go put your name and the book&#x2019;s name on the leader board, Paula. I&#x2019;d like to keep the book though.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Will do,&#x201d; Paula said. She left the room with one more pump of her fist.</p><p>&#x201c;Wow, twenty years overdue, what ILS were they using back then?&#x201d; Beth asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Dynix?&#x201d; Lindsey guessed. She glanced at the book, which looked to have been well taken care of over the years. &#x201c;Remember we learned about that integrated library system in grad school? Let&#x2019;s see, if we calculate the fine at today&#x2019;s going rate of twenty cents per day for twenty years, we&#x2019;re looking at&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. help me out, somebody.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;About seventy-three dollars per year, which would be fourteen hundred sixty dollars,&#x201d; Mary said.</p><p>They all looked at her.</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m good with numbers.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Impressive,&#x201d; Nancy said.</p><p>&#x201c;As opposed to ignominious,&#x201d; Violet joked.</p><p>&#x201c;Good thing you&#x2019;re having an amnesty,&#x201d; Charlene said. &#x201c;Can you imagine paying that fine?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;d never charge more than the cost of the book, but you&#x2019;re right it&#x2019;s steep, although not as bad as Keith Richards&#x2019;s library fines I&#x2019;ll bet,&#x201d; Lindsey said.</p><p>&#x201c;Keith Richards the rock star?&#x201d; Violet asked.</p><p>&#x201c;The one and only,&#x201d; Lindsey said. &#x201c;Apparently, he was quite the library lover in his youth. In his autobiography, he said the library was the only place he would willingly obey the laws, like silence. And he admitted he was a bookworm who checked out books but never returned them. He has something like fifty years in fines racked up in Dartford, Kent.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ha! Can you imagine Ms. Cole taking on Keith Richards?&#x201d; Nancy asked. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d pay to see that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Me, too,&#x201d; Violet snorted.</p><p>&#x201c;Who do you suppose had this book checked out for twenty years?&#x201d; Charlene asked. &#x201c;And why return it now?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll bet the lemon knows,&#x201d; Beth said. &#x201c;She never forgets an overdue book.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She can&#x2019;t have kept the records that far bac...</p></p><h2>The Interior Castle: Study Edition [includes Full Text of St. Teresa of Avila&#39;s Work, Translated by Kieran Kavanaugh, OCD]</h2><p>The Interior Castle is more than a book. It is a powerful image of the mystery of the human person. It is the soul of St. Teresa of Avila, who journeys through the castle from one dwelling place to another mapping out a feminine, yet warlike, program for the Christian spiritual life. It is also the last book Teresa wrote: in 1577, five years before she died, she recorded, to the best of her knowledge, the experiences for which she praised God.<br><br>Reading Teresa herself is indispensable. The authors of this study edition designed it as a springboard to reading and understanding Teresas text. They present a chapter of Teresas book, followed by a review of the progress of her thought and the principal ideas in each chapter. Next they give interpretive notes: doctrinal, historical, and sociological. Then because Teresa wanted her writings to be in harmony with sacred Scripture, they point out scriptural texts that support her ideas.<br><br>Finally, the authors show how teachings of the present-day church demonstrate both how Teresas basic notions were correct and how we can apply her principles to our times.</p><p>&#34;Not only beautiful, it is remarkably sensual.&#34;</p><h2>The Little Book of Elves and Fairies</h2><p>This exciting mix of poems and stories about fairies will draw the reader into the hidden world of fantasy.

He was in the Tomb. That's what the inmates called it. It was late in the evening and he was alone here, in the Tomb, in the odd April cold. He was watching gray vapors drift up from a small lantern beside his bunk that offered up rising battalions of ghostly dancers who twisted and swirled, then disappeared before they met the Tomb's low rock ceiling.<br><br> The Tomb was solitary confinement, and the only reason Driggs was provided a lantern at all was so he could read the Bible that was left next to his bunk. It was the warden's wife's idea. She felt it a civic and moral duty-for those who could in fact read-to spread the Gospel.<br><br> The Tomb was in an isolated area separated from the main compound. This place, this penitentiary, was simply referred to by the inmates as Hell. It had another proper name when it was built, but that title was long ago forgotten and it was usually called Hell. Some referred to the massive stone structure as the Hell Hole or the Hot Box on the Hubs of Hell. The prison was meant to hold a maximum of two hundred and sixty prisoners, but it was currently overcrowded and brimming with close to three hundred. It was located in the desert-nearly one hundred miles from the closest town in every direction-and escaping Hell had proved to be near impossible. Driggs had considered escaping more then a few times but never found a way out that made any sense. Over the years a few had tried, but they all died in their attempts.<br><br> Normally this rock palace, Hell, was a sweltering-hot compound, a place where it was much easier to catch a heat-related disease than it was to catch a decent breath. But at times, when the temperature dropped, the prisoners would say, "Ol' Sam pulled the goddamn lever." Sam Satan, he was the operator, the true proprietor of Hell, and every so often he opened the gallows trapdoor that dropped in a strange, unseasonably glacial chill.<br><br> The prisoners would mostly die in the sweltering heat, of edema or syncope, of tetany, or stroke, or the galloping consumption, but the cold was also threatening. Since the place was constructed, through the consecutive hot summers and occasional cold winters, there had been more than a dozen men who couldn't tolerate the conditions and took their own lives, usually by hanging from the bars at the end of a ripped blanket snugged around the neck.<br><br> Unlike thick-walled adobe structures that kept in the cool, this place was made from stone with walls built just thin enough to allow the outside temperatures to conveniently creep inside like an unwanted guest. Then there would be stretches of time in the winter when the chill would last for weeks, sometimes months.<br><br> The earliest inmates lived in tents, shackled by ball and chain as they erected the cavernous compound that overlooked a vast desert in every direction. And after a few years of hard labor, the prisoners moved into the very cells they had built, sealing their fate.<br><br> Set high up on a rocky bluff where the harsh sun and winter gales would insult and diminish the most capable, everyone-the guards, the administration, the warden, even the governor-understood that this place was in every way damnation and most certainly the work of the Devil himself.<br><br> The week previous it had been scorching hot, but this particular night in April was for some reason freezing, and the wind brought with it some uncommon moisture. Now, miserable wetness was added to the frigid April air. It traversed through the chambers and across the rock floor tunnels of the prison compound, making a bitter cold night even colder. But Driggs was okay with it. He knew this brief bit of unseasonably cold weather was just a passing snap.<br><br> Driggs was not good being on the inside, though. Being locked up in prison just did not suit him. He was not keen on authority, and as a result his insubordination kept landing him in confinement, in the Tomb. He didn't mind it, really. In some ways Driggs preferred being in the Tomb to sharing a cell with others. Especially since the prison was overcrowded. At least this way, sequestered in the Tomb, he didn't have to listen to ignorant conversations or tolerate stupid questions by the other prisoners, who were certain Driggs would know the answer to any and all.<br><br> No one really even knew Driggs. In fact, Driggs was not Driggs, not here on the inside. He was arrested, convicted, and incarcerated under the name Donnie Lonnigan. Through the years after the war, Driggs had assumed a number of names-aliases that kept him, as he preferred to be, a man unknown. From time to time throughout his past he was not above remaining in a place and blending in as a somewhat normal person among the masses, but for the most part he was a lone wolf.<br><br> Driggs was smart and everyone knew that about him. He was by no means the standard man found behind the walls of the institution. Most were common thieves, robbers of one kind or another. Some were rapists, some were on the inside for having too many wives, and some, like Driggs, were killers.<br><br> Driggs was different, though, and everyone knew it, they saw it and sensed it. Everyone looked up to Driggs. There was something about Driggs that average men did not possess. Other men felt safe with Driggs near. It was not that Driggs took up for them in any way, but it was the simple fact that he carried himself as if he meant something, as if he had a purpose, and that purpose gave the aimless others reasons to revere him. Everyone thought him mysterious-mythical, even. Some thought Driggs was an aberration, a ghost, but most felt he was in some way-though they had no real reason to believe this-their protector, their Savior, their Jesus. Not unlike Jesus, Driggs frightened the guards.<br><br> Even though they were the ones with the guns, Driggs unnerved them. It was his simple and still manner that intimidated them, his centered, relaxed frame; shoulders lowered, his long sinewy arms comfortably by his sides. And it was the way he walked. He moved unlike the normal man. He was more like a muscled Thoroughbred stallion. Not the poised ready-to-run type with ears back and head rising and falling. No. Driggs was calm and sure as he moved, always with his body squared, his hips and torso moving together, his head up high, supported by his long, muscly neck. His face was handsome and sturdy, and his hair was a shock of varying hardwood colors-blond, brown, and dark brown-that he wore at a medium length and combed back from his strong, browed forehead. He kept his keen blue-green eyes slightly hidden behind a squint that was more relaxed and natural than involuntary or intentional. His chin was square and his cheekbones were high. Driggs was the quiet type, too, answering annoying questions with a simple adjustment of his jawbone rather than words. He moved his tall, muscular frame effortlessly, as if he were not just a gallant steed but also a prescient, all-knowing predator. This unsettling power Driggs possessed prompted the warden to throw Driggs into the Tomb for simply being himself.<br><br> 2<br><br> Driggs was educated, formally as well as self-taught. He was good with English, science, and math. He possessed skills far greater than his fellow students, but he also learned other needed abilities when he left the boring institutions and set out on his own. Eventually he ended up at West Point, but for many years previous he was a traveler, never staying in one place too long. Yet here, in this godforsaken place, he was going on close to four years. Driggs was a killer, no doubt about that, but he did his killing with precision. It started on the battlefield, that is where he got a taste for it, a bloodthirsty hankering. He was not just a good shot with a pistol or a long rifle, but he was also formidable in hand-to-hand combat. He learned his skills at the Point, where he graduated in the top in his class, but now he was here, living like a caged animal in the Devil's Hot Box on the Very Hubs of Hell.<br><br> Driggs heard someone, somewhere, call out with a mournful moan, "God help me!" And from someplace else within the dungeon another prisoner laughed, a loud, mad, and raspy bone-chilling laugh that was as cold as the chilly April air: "God? There is no God here, you pitiful fool." Driggs smiled to himself a little and thought about God. God . . . Jesus . . . God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. One and the same, so the Bible says.<br><br> He picked up the Bible lying next to the lamp and thumbed through the pages as he thought about the warden's wife. He was glad she provided the Good Book, and Driggs did not mind reading the scriptures. On the contrary, he actually got some enjoyment out of the stories. He liked the Old Testament. The stories of Noah and Moses especially, but he liked some of the new parts, too, the New Testament. He particularly appreciated one part. In fact, it was the only part he read anymore. He was drawn to the otherworldliness of it, the strangeness of it, its wildness, and he liked the way the words were put together. He understood it completely. It reminded him of the battlefield. It was as if it was written for him. He even memorized parts of it.<br><br> "'I am the Alpha and Omega,'" Driggs said out loud.<br><br> He watched the dancing vapors twisting up out of the chimney of the lamp. He put his hand over it, feeling the heat as he quietly continued reciting.<br><br> "'I heard behind me a great voice like a trumpet. And when I turned to see the voice that spoke to me I saw seven golden candlesticks. And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one was like the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to his feet, with a golden sash across his chest. His eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet were like brass as if they burned in a furnace, and his voice was the sound of raging water. In his right hand he had seven stars and coming out of his mouth was a razor sharp double-edged sword.'"<br><br> Driggs was stimulated by the words. They made him feel even more powerful than he physically was. When he read about the winds and the stars, and the horses and the dragon, he always thought of her . . . of what she smelled like, of how she might taste. The warden's wife was not just the only woman within one hundred miles in every direction, but she was also fucking attractive, Driggs thought. It was said, though she wore dresses made from the best fabrics, that she was the one who wore the breeches in the family. Driggs could tell that just by looking at her and he liked that, that she possessed power. He had seen her numerous times and he knew it was just a matter of time until he would have her. One way or the other he would take away her power. He was certain that women like that needed him to undo the need to control. He could tell by the way she looked at him from across the yard every time he was escorted to the Tomb. But Driggs was used to that, most women wanted him to do that. He had that quality, that way about him. Driggs rested the Bible on his chest, and as he thought more about the warden's wife he heard a key slip into the lock of his door. He sat up some, thinking it odd to be pulled out of the Tomb at night; that had never happened before. Then the door very slowly opened but no one came in. Driggs reached over and turned out the lamp, then moved to the foot of his bunk, closer to the door, and sat quietly. He stayed there until his eyes adjusted completely to the dark. After a moment he could see the deep blue of the night, visible above the dark silhouette of the compound walls, but he did not move, not yet. Driggs was a cautious man, he had instincts, and his instincts for the moment told him to wait. He waited and listened but heard nothing, then he moved to the door and looked out but did not step out. He stood in the doorway for a long moment, listening, but all he could hear was the wind. Then he crept out slightly. He stopped just a step past the door and looked about. He looked to his left and then to his right. He looked behind him. There was no one in sight and there were no lamps burning. All was silent and then Driggs said quietly to himself, "Fear not, I am the first and the last. I am he that lives. I was dead but behold I am alive for evermore. And I hold the keys of hell and death. I saw heaven open and I behold a white horse and he who sat upon him was called faithful and true. And in righteousness he doth judge and make war. The is the second death. And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent called the Devil and Satan who deceived the world was cast down to earth."<br><br> 3<br><br> "Three thousand people living here now in Appaloosa," I said.<br><br> "Two thousand nine hundred and something too many," Virgil said.<br><br> "Well, it's a good thing for Allie," I said.<br><br> Virgil nodded.<br><br> "Hope she can make money," I said.<br><br> "Goddamn do, too, Everett."<br><br> "Cost you a cent or two to put this together."<br><br> "Two and then some," Virgil said.<br><br> "Well, it's good, even though you can't throw a rock without hitting a human being, she don't got that much competition that she has to contend with."<br><br> "For the time being," Virgil said.<br><br> "Gives her some independence."<br><br> "Her?"<br><br> "You, too," I said.<br><br> Virgil said nothing for a moment.<br><br> "Times are changing, it seems."<br><br> I laughed out loud.<br><br> "Goddamn right about that," I said.<br><br> "Surprises are far and few between."<br><br> "Well, she's happy," I said.<br><br> "She is," Virgil said.<br><br> "Guess it could be Mrs. Cole's?"<br><br> Virgil looked to me.<br><br> "If you and Allie were married she could have called it Mrs. Cole's?"

It was from other field hands that she first heard about the Underground Railroad which she travelled by herself north to Philadelphia. Throughout her long life (she died at the age of ninety-two) and long after the Civil War brought an end to slavery, this amazing woman was proof of what just one person can do.</p><p>Yona Zeldis McDonough is a longtime doll lover and collector.

It may have been 1820 or 1821. Almost everyone thought the birth of a slave baby wasn&#x2019;t worth remembering. Born a slave, Harriet Tubman grew into a brave and daring young woman. She was brave enough to escape from slavery. She was daring enough to help others escape, too. Because she led so many to freedom, she was called &#x201c;Moses.&#x201d; Like Moses in the Bible, Harriet Tubman believed that her people should be free. And she risked her life many times to help them become free. Even after she had escaped safely from the South, she went back to take other slaves north to freedom. Here is her story.</p><p>Chapter 1<br>Life in Maryland</p><p>Sometime around 1820 in Maryland, a slave named Harriet Ross had a baby girl. Neither Harriet, who was called Old Rit, nor her husband, Ben, could read or write, so they couldn&#x2019;t record the year of the baby&#x2019;s birth. No one else thought it was worth doing. But Old Rit loved her tiny child and wanted to protect her. She hoped her little girl, whose nickname was Minty, would learn to sew, cook, or weave. Then she could be a house slave and avoid the backbreaking work picking crops like tobacco, corn, or wheat in the fields.</p></p><h2>Be the Man</h2><p>MEN ARE LOST.<br><p> MEN ARE ALONE.<br></p><p> MEN ARE CONFUSED.<br></p><p> Men are desperately attempting to answer what appears to be a very simple question, being asked by the women closest to them. <br></p><p> What is wrong with you? <br></p><p> Why Don't You Just BE THE MAN? <br></p><p> As much as I wanted to blame my dad for not raising me to be a man, the truth was, my father (like me) had been born into a Generational Game of Sedation that had been destroying the masculinity in men around the globe for almost a century. <br></p><p> Living in power as a Man these days is almost impossible, with the confusing set up of twisted rules and archaic guidelines that men are supposed to follow to BE THE MAN. <br></p><p> My Brother.

Should you focus on earning a living, pursuing your passions, or devoting yourself to the causes that inspire you? The surprising truth is that you don&#x2019;t have to choose&#x2014;and that you&#x2019;ll find more success if you don&#x2019;t. That&#x2019;s the breakthrough message of TOMS&#x2019; One for One movement. You don&#x2019;t have to be rich to give back and you don&#x2019;t have to retire to spend every day doing what you love. You can find profit, passion, and meaning all at once&#x2014;<i>right now</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>In <i>Start Something That Matters,</i> Blake Mycoskie tells the story of TOMS, one of the fastest-growing shoe companies in the world, and combines it with lessons learned from such other innovative organizations as method, charity: water, FEED Projects, and TerraCycle. Blake presents the six simple keys for creating or transforming your own life and business, from discovering your core story to being resourceful without resources; from overcoming fear and doubt to incorporating giving into every aspect of your life. No matter what kind of change you&#x2019;re considering, <i>Start Something That Matters</i> gives you the stories, ideas, and practical tips that can help you get started.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br><b>Why this book is for you: </b><br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>� You&#x2019;re ready to make a difference in the world&#x2014;through your own start-up business, a nonprofit organization, or a new project that you create within your current job.<br>� You want to love your work, work for what you love, and have a positive impact on the world&#x2014;<i>all at the same time</i>.<br>� You&#x2019;re inspired by charity: water, method, and FEED Projects and want to learn how these organizations got their start. <br>� You&#x2019;re curious about how someone who never made a pair of shoes, attended fashion school, or worked in retail created one of the fastest-growing footwear companies in the world by <i>giving</i> shoes away.<br>� You&#x2019;re looking for a new model of success to share with your children, students, co-workers, and members of your community.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>You&#x2019;re ready to start something that matters.</b></p></p><p><strong>A Letter from Author Blake Mycoskie</strong> <br> <br> People often ask me what I consider my goal to be at TOMS. The truth is that it&#x2019;s changed over the years. When we first began, the goal was to create a for-profit company to help the children that I met in a small village in Argentina. And that objective to give new shoes to children in need continues to be a powerful driver for me and everyone else at TOMS. <p></p> But recently my personal mission has changed. Today, I would say that my goal is to influence other people to go out into the world and have a positive impact, to inspire others to start something that matters, whether it&#x2019;s a for-profit business or a nonprofit organization. I feel a deep sense of responsibility to share everything that we&#x2019;ve learned from TOMS, so that others can learn from both our mistakes and the counterintuitive principles that have guided our success. <p></p> I would also like to share the stories of other social entrepreneurs, from all walks of life, who are taking that wonderful and courageous step forward, who are moving from thinking about doing something to actually doing it. Among many others, the leaders profiled in my book include Tony Hsieh (founder of Zappos), Scott Harrison (founder of charity: water), Lauren Bush (founder of FEED Projects), Eric Ryan &amp; Adam Lowry (co-founders of method) and Tim Ferriss (author of The 4-Hour Workweek). <p></p> Like me, all of the people featured in the book faced insecurities and fear when first starting out. All of us bootstrapped with limited resources, and made countless mistakes along the way. After reading these stories of success, I hope that you&#x2019;ll realize that <i>you already have everything you need to get started</i>. You don&#x2019;t need a lot of money, a complicated business plan, or a great deal of experience to get your idea off the ground. What you absolutely must have, however, is the courage to take that first bold step forward.... <p></p> For me, the ultimate success of this book will be measured not by how many copies it sells but by the number of people whom it inspires. <i>Are you ready to start something that matters? </i> <p></p> Carpe Diem,<br> Blake <p></p><p>In 2006, <b>Blake Mycoskie</b> founded TOMS Shoes with a simple business model: &#x201c;With every pair you purchase, TOMS will give a pair of new shoes to a child in need. One for One.&#x201d; In 2011, TOMS launched its second One for One product, TOMS Eyewear, which with every pair purchased helps give sight to a person in need by providing medical treatment, prescription glasses, or sight-saving surgery. Mycoskie will be using 50 percent of his proceeds from this book to create the Start Something That Matters Fund, which will support inspired readers in their efforts to make a positive impact on the world.<br>&nbsp;<br>When Blake isn&#x2019;t working at TOMS, he spends his time reading, writing, fly-fishing, and participating in just about every board sport.</p></p><h2>Horizons Math 5th Grade Student Book 1 (Lifepac)</h2><p>Full color student Book One for the first half of the grade 5 math curriculum includes 80 lessons and 8 tests.

Founded in 1927, it now numbers fifty monks. The Abbey, founded in memory of Blessed Columba Marmion, is dedicated to Saints Joseph and Columba. It belongs to the Congregation of the Annunciation, in the confederation of Benedictine monks.</p><p>The Glenstal Book of Prayer is a rich resource for the dark, mysterious, but exciting journey which is prayer. It draws on the wisdom of the Bible, enshrined in Benedictine liturgy, on the experience of modern monks, and on the wisdom of the Christian Church. Coming as it does from an Irish monastery, it reflects in a special way the Celtic traditionwith its earthy, popular, and devotional prayers.&#34;Attractively jacketed, beautifully printed, this little book seems to answer everyone&#39;s needs....A handsome text that is an excellent gift.&#34;</p><h2>A Visit from the Goon Squad</h2><p>Jennifer Egan&#39;s spellbinding novel circles the lives of Bennie Salazar, an aging former punk rocker and record executive, and Sasha, the passionate, troubled young woman he employs. Although Bennie and Sasha never discover each other&#39;s pasts, the reader does, in intimate detail, along with the secret lives of a host of other characters whose paths intersect with theirs, over many years, in locales as varied as New York, San Francisco, Naples, and Africa. We first meet Sasha in her mid-thirties, on her therapist&#39;s couch in New York City, confronting her longstanding compulsion to steal. Later, we learn the genesis of her turmoil when we see her as the child of a violent marriage, then a runaway living in Naples, then as a college student trying to avert the suicidal impulses of her best friend. We meet Bennie Salazar at the melancholy nadir of his adult life-divorced, struggling to connect with his nine-year-old son, listening to a washed up band in the basement of a suburban house-and then revisit him in 1979, at the height of his youth, shy and tender, reveling in San Francisco&#39;s punk scene as he discovers his ardor for rock and roll and his gift for spotting talent. We learn what became of his high school gang-who thrived and who faltered-and we encounter Lou Kline, Bennie&#39;s catastrophically careless mentor, along with the lovers and children left behind in the wake of Lou&#39;s far flung sexual conquests and meteoric rise and fall. A Visit from the Goon Squad is a book about the interplay of time and music, about survival, about the stirrings and transformations set inexorably in motion by even the most passing conjunction of our fates. In a breathtaking array of styles and tones ranging from tragedy to satire to Powerpoint, Egan captures the undertow of self-destruction that we all must either master or succumb to; the basic human hunger for redemption; and the universal tendency to reach for both-and escape the merciless progress of time-in the transporting realms of art and music. Sly, startling, exhilarating work from one of our boldest writers.</p><p>Jennifer Egan is the author of The Keep, Look at Me, The Invisible Circus, and the story collection Emerald City. Her stories have been published in The New Yorker, Harper&#39;s Magazine, GQ, Zoetrope, All-Story, and Ploughshares, and her nonfiction appears frequently in The New York Times Magazine. She lives with her husband and sons in Brooklyn.Chapter 1<br><br>Found Objects<br><br>It began the usual way, in the bathroom of the Lassimo Hotel. Sasha was adjusting her yellow eye shadow in the mirror when she noticed a bag<br><br>on the floor beside the sink that must have belonged to the woman<br><br>whose peeing she could faintly hear through the vaultlike door of a toilet stall. Inside the rim of the bag, barely visible, was a wallet made of pale green leather. It was easy for Sasha to recognize, looking back, that the peeing woman's blind trust had provoked her: <i>We live in a city where people will steal the hair off your head if you give them half a chance, but you leave your stuff lying in plain sight and expect it to be waiting for you when you come back?</i> It made her want to teach the woman a lesson. But this wish only camouflaged the deeper feeling Sasha always had: that at, tender wallet, offering itself to her hand-it seemed so dull, so life-as-usual to just leave it there rather than seize the moment, accept the challenge, take the leap, fly the coop, throw caution to the wind, live dangerously ("I get it," Coz, her therapist, said), and take the fucking thing.<br><br>"You mean steal it."<br><br>He was trying to get Sasha to use that word, which was harder to avoid in the case of a wallet than with a lot of the things she'd lifted over the past year, when her condition (as Coz referred to it) had begun to accelerate: five sets of keys, fourteen pairs of sunglasses, a child's striped scarf, binoculars, a cheese grater, a pocketknife, twenty-eight bars of soap, and eighty-five pens, ranging from cheap ballpoints she'd used to sign debit-card slips to the aubergine Visconti that cost two hundred sixty dollars online, which she'd lifted from her former boss's lawyer during a contracts meeting. Sasha no longer took anything from stores-their cold, inert goods didn't tempt her. Only from people.<br><br>"Okay," she said. "Steal it."<br><br>Sasha and Coz had dubbed that feeling she got the "personal challenge," as in: taking the wallet was a way for Sasha to assert her toughness, her individuality. What they needed to do was switch things around in her head so that the challenge became not taking the wallet but leaving it. That would be the cure, although Coz never used words like "cure." He wore funky sweaters and let her call him Coz, but he was old school inscrutable, to the point where Sasha couldn't tell if he was gay or straight, if he'd written famous books, or if (as she sometimes suspected) he was one of those escaped cons who impersonate surgeons and wind<br><br>up leaving their operating tools inside people's skulls. Of course, these questions could have been resolved on Google in less than a minute, but they were useful questions (according to Coz), and so far, Sasha had resisted.<br><br>The couch where she lay in his office was blue leather and very soft. Coz liked the couch, he'd told her, because it relieved them both of the burden of eye contact. "You don't like eye contact?" Sasha had asked. It seemed like a weird thing for a therapist to admit.<br><br>"I find it tiring," he'd said. "This way, we can both look where we want."<br><br>"Where will you look?"<br><br>He smiled. "You can see my options."<br><br>"Where do you usually look? When people are on the couch."<br><br>"Around the room," Coz said. "At the ceiling. Into space."<br><br>"Do you ever sleep?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>Sasha usually looked at the window, which faced the street, and tonight, as she continued her story, was rippled with rain. She'd glimpsed the wallet, tender and overripe as a peach. She'd plucked it from the woman's bag and slipped it into her own small handbag, which she'd zipped shut before the sound of peeing had stopped. She'd flicked open the bathroom door and floated back through the lobby to the bar. She and the wallet's owner had never seen each other.<br><br>Prewallet, Sasha had been in the grip of a dire evening: lame date (yet another) brooding behind dark bangs, sometimes glancing at the flat-screen TV, where a Jets game seemed to interest him more than Sasha's admittedly overhandled tales of Bennie Salazar, her old boss, who was famous for founding the Sow's Ear record label and who also (Sasha happened to know) sprinkled gold flakes into his coffee-as an aphrodisiac, she suspected-and sprayed pesticide in his armpits.<br><br>Postwallet, however, the scene tingled with mirthful possibility. Sasha felt the waiters eyeing her as she sidled back to the table holding her handbag with its secret weight. She sat down and took a sip of her Melon Madness Martini and cocked her head at Alex. She smiled her yes/no smile. "Hello," she said.<br><br>The yes/no smile was amazingly effective.<br><br>"You're happy," Alex said.<br><br>"I'm always happy," Sasha said. "Sometimes I just forget."<br><br>Alex had paid the bill while she was in the bathroom-clear proof that he'd been on the verge of aborting their date. Now he studied her. "You feel like going somewhere else?"<br><br>They stood. Alex wore black cords and a white button-up shirt. He was a legal secretary. On e-mail he'd been fanciful, almost goofy, but in person he seemed simultaneously anxious and bored. She could tell that he was in excellent shape, not from going to the gym but from being young enough that his body was still imprinted with whatever sports he'd played in high school and college. Sasha, who was thirty-five, had passed that point. Still, not even Coz knew her real age. The closest anyone had come to guessing it was thirty-one, and most put her in her twenties. She worked out daily and avoided the sun. Her online profiles all listed her as twenty-eight.<br><br>As she followed Alex from the bar, she couldn't resist unzipping her purse and touching the fat green wallet just for a second, for the contraction it made her feel around her heart.<br><br>"You're aware of how the theft makes <i>you</i> feel," Coz said. "To the point where you remind yourself of it to improve your mood. But do you think about how it makes the other person feel?"<br><br>Sasha tipped back her head to look at him. She made a point of doing this now and then, just to remind Coz that she wasn't an idiot-she knew the question had a right answer. She and Coz were collaborators, writing a story whose end had already been determined: she would get well. She would stop stealing from people and start caring again about the things that had once guided her: music; the network of friends she'd made when she first came to New York; a set of goals she'd scrawled on a big sheet of newsprint and taped to the walls of her early apartments:<br><br>Find a band to manage<br>Understand the news<br>Study Japanese<br>Practice the harp<br><br>"I don't think about the people," Sasha said.<br><br>"But it isn't that you lack empathy," Coz said. "We know that, because of the plumber."<br><br>Sasha sighed. She'd told Coz the plumber story about a month ago, and he'd found a way to bring it up at almost every session since. The plumber was an old man, sent by Sasha's landlord to investigate a leak in the apartment below hers. He'd appeared in Sasha's doorway, tufts of gray on his head, and within a minute-<i>boom</i>-he'd hit the floor and crawled under her bathtub like an animal fumbling its way into a familiar hole. The fingers he'd groped toward the bolts behind the tub were grimed to cigar stubs, and reaching made his sweatshirt hike up, exposing a soft white back. Sasha turned away, stricken by the old man's abasement, anxious to leave for her temp job, except that the plumber was talking to her, asking about the length and frequency of her showers. "I never use it," she told him curtly. "I shower at the gym." He nodded without acknowledging her rudeness, apparently used to it. Sasha's nose began to prickle; she shut her eyes and pushed hard on both temples.<br><br>Opening her eyes, she saw the plumber's tool belt lying on the floor at her feet. It had a beautiful screwdriver in it, the orange translucent handle gleaming like a lollipop in its worn leather loop, the silvery shaft sculpted, sparkling. Sasha felt herself contract around the object in a single yawn of appetite; she needed to hold the screwdriver, just for a minute. She bent her knees and plucked it noiselessly from the belt. Not a bangle jangled; her bony hands were spastic at most things, but she was good at this-<i>made for it</i>, she often thought, in the first drifty moments after lifting something. And once the screwdriver was in her hand, she felt instant relief from the pain of having an old soft-backed man snuffling under her tub, and then something more than relief: a blessed indifference, as if the very idea of feeling pain over such a thing were baffling.<br><br>"And what about after he'd gone?" Coz had asked when Sasha told him the story. "How did the screwdriver look to you then?"<br><br>There was a pause. "Normal," she said.<br><br>"Really. Not special anymore?"<br><br>"Like any screwdriver."<br><br>Sasha had heard Coz shift behind her and felt something happen in the room: the screwdriver, which she'd placed on the table (recently supplemented with a second table) where she kept the things she'd lifted, and which she'd barely looked at since, seemed to hang in the air of Coz's office. It floated between them: a symbol.<br><br>"And how did you feel?" Coz asked quietly. "About having taken it from the plumber you pitied?"<br><br>How did she feel? <i>How did she feel?</i> There was a right answer, of course. At times Sasha had to fight the urge to lie simply as a way of depriving Coz of it.<br><br>"Bad," she said. "Okay? I felt bad. Shit, I'm bankrupting myself to pay for you-obviously I get that this isn't a great way to live."<br><br>More than once, Coz had tried to connect the plumber to Sasha's father, who had disappeared when she was six. She was careful not to indulge this line of thinking. "I don't remember him," she told Coz. "I have nothing to say." She did this for Coz's protection and her own- they were writing a story of redemption, of fresh beginnings and second chances. But in that direction lay only sorrow.<br><br>Sasha and Alex crossed the lobby of the Lassimo Hotel in the direction of the street. Sasha hugged her purse to her shoulder, the warm ball of wallet snuggled in her armpit. As they passed the angular budded branches by the big glass doors to the street, a woman zigzagged into their path. "Wait," she said. "You haven't seen-I'm desperate."<br><br>Sasha felt a twang of terror. It was the woman whose wallet she'd taken-she knew this instantly, although the person before her had nothing in common with the blithe, raven-haired wallet owner she'd pictured. This woman had vulnerable brown eyes and flat pointy shoes that clicked too loudly on the marble floor. There was plenty of gray in her frizzy brown hair.<br><br>Sasha took Alex's arm, trying to steer him through the doors. She felt his pulse of surprise at her touch, but he stayed put. "Have we seen what?" he said.<br><br>"Someone stole my wallet. My ID is gone, and I have to catch a plane tomorrow morning. I'm just desperate!" She stared beseechingly at both of them. It was the sort of frank need that New Yorkers quickly learn how to hide, and Sasha recoiled. It had never occurred to her that the woman was from out of town.<br><br>"Have you called the police?" Alex asked.<br><br>"The concierge said he would call. But I'm also wondering-could it have fallen out somewhere?" She looked helplessly at the marble floor around their feet. Sasha relaxed slightly. This woman was the type who annoyed people without meaning to; apology shadowed her movements even now, as she followed Alex to the concierge's desk. Sasha trailed behind.<br><br>"Is someone helping this person?" she heard Alex ask.<br><br>The concierge was young and spiky haired. "We've called the police," he said defensively.<br><br>Alex turned to the woman. "Where did this happen?"<br><br>"In the ladies' room. I think."<br><br>"Who else was there?"<br><br>"No one."<br><br>"It was empty?"<br><br>"There might have been someone, but I didn't see her."<br><br>Alex swung around to Sasha. "You were just in the bathroom," he said. "Did you see anyone?"<br><br>"No," she managed to say. She had Xanax in her purse, but she couldn't open her purse. Even with it zipped, she feared that the wallet would blurt into view in some way that she couldn't control, unleashing a cascade of horrors: arrest, shame, poverty, death.<br><br>Alex turned to the concierge. "How come I'm asking these questions instead of you?" he said. "Someone just got robbed in your hotel. Don't you have, like, security?"<br><br>The words "robbed" and "security" managed to pierce the soothing backbeat that pumped through not just the Lassimo but every hotel like it in New York City. There was a mild ripple of interest from the lobby.<br><br>"I've called security," the concierge said, adjusting his neck. "I'll call them again."<br><br>Sasha glanced at Alex. He was angry, and the anger made him recognizable in a way that an hour of aimless chatter (mostly hers, it was true) had not: he was new to New York. He came from someplace smaller. He had a thing or two to prove about how people should treat one another.<br><br>Two security guys showed up, the same on TV and in life: beefy guys whose scrupulous politeness was somehow linked to their willingness to crack skulls. They dispersed to search the bar. Sasha wished feverishly that she'd left the wallet there, as if this were an impulse she'd barely resisted.<br><br>"I'll check the bathroom," she told Alex, and forced herself to walk slowly around the elevator bank. The bathroom was empty. Sasha opened her purse, took out the wallet, unearthed her vial of Xanax, and popped one between her teeth. They worked faster if you chewed them. As the caustic taste flooded her mouth, she scanned the room, trying to decide where to ditch the wallet: In the stall? Under the sink? The decision paralyzed her. She had to do this right, to emerge unscathed, and if she could, if she did-she had a frenzied sense of making a promise to Coz.<br><br>The bathroom door opened, and the woman walked in. Her frantic eyes met Sasha's in the bathroom mirror: narrow, green, equally frantic. There was a pause, during which Sasha felt that she was being confronted; the woman knew, had known all along. Sasha handed her the wallet. She saw, from the woman's stunned expression, that she was wrong.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>The Nature of Doctrine: Religion and Theology in a Postliberal Age</h2><p>This groundbreaking work lays the foundation for a theology based on a cultural-linguistic approach to religion and a regulative or rule theory of doctrine.

Despite the fact that science has revolutionized every aspect of human life and greatly clarified our understanding of the world, somehow the notion has arisen that it has nothing to say about the possibility of a supreme being, which much of humanity worships as the source of all reality. This physicist and author contends that, if God exists, some evidence for this existence should be detectable by scientific means, especially considering the central role that God is alleged to play in the operation of the universe and the lives of humans. Treating the traditional God concept, as conventionally presented in the Judeo-Christian and Islamic traditions, like any other scientific hypothesis, Stenger examines all of the claims made for God&#39;s existence. He considers the latest Intelligent Design arguments as evidence of God&#39;s influence in biology. He looks at human behavior for evidence of immaterial souls and the possible effects of prayer. He discusses the findings of physics and astronomy in weighing the suggestions that the universe is the work of a creator and that humans are God&#39;s special creation. After evaluating all the scientific evidence, Stenger concludes that beyond a reasonable doubt the universe and life appear exactly as we might expect if there were no God.</p><p><b>Victor J. Stenger</b>&nbsp;(1935 - 2014) was an adjunct professor of philosophy at the University of Colorado and emeritus professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Hawaii.

It should be widely read."<br>-Sam Harris, author of the New York Times bestsellers The End of Faith and Letter to a Christian Nation<br><br>"Extremely tough and impressive...a great book...a huge addition to the arsenal of argument."<br>-Christopher Hitchens, author of the New York Times bestseller God Is Not Great</p><h2>Katie And The Sunflowers</h2><p>While visiting the art museum, Katie has an adventure stepping in and out of five paintings by Van Gogh, Gauguin, and Cezanne, in a story with information about Post-impressionism and the particular paintings and artists.</p><p>James Mayhew studied at Maidstone College of Art and his first children&#39;s book, Katie&#39;s Picture Show was published in 1989. It&#39;s been firmly in print ever since, recognised universally as the original and best introduction to art for children. Many more titles have followed, and the series sells in museums and galleries all over the world, from the Met in New York, to the Uffizi in Florence, the Louvre in Paris and beyond. He is also the creator of the much-loved Ella Bella Ballerina series, and many other titles. Alongside his work in publishing, James has devised and performed in a hugely successful series of concerts for children, combining live classical music, storytelling and live art. From Peter and the Wolf, to Scheherazade, James has worked internationally with many different orchestras and musicians, creating illustrations in time to music. James grew up in Suffolk but now lives in Hertfordshire.Kindergarten-Grade 3-In this, the third story about Katie's art adventures, the girl and her grandmother leave their garden on a rainy day to go to the museum. The child is drawn to Vincent van Gogh's Sunflowers, and discovers she can reach in and touch them. Alas, she bumps the vase and the whole arrangement falls out of the painting and onto the floor. She hears laughter coming from Paul Gauguin's Breton Girls Dancing hanging nearby, and she enters that canvas and enlists the help of one of the girls. Further pandemonium ensues, involving interaction with more paintings, including Paul C?zanne's Still Life with Apples and Oranges. These featured artists, readers are informed on the last page, are the Postimpressionists, known for their use of strong color and line to express feeling. Mayhew's wonderful watercolor illustrations capture the strength of the paintings and, as their contents and people spill out into Katie's world, they change just enough to look as though they could belong there. While the idea of showcasing the paintings is the primary focus and the story secondary, this book succeeds as a lively and imaginative introduction to fine-art appreciation.<br><i>Carolyn Jenks, First Parish Unitarian Church, Portland, ME </i><br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Connect Bible NRSV</h2><p>The Connect Bible (NRSV) is used for both Holy Moly Sunday School and Connect Tween Sunday School.

Using Custer�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s Last Stand as a metaphor for what Americans feared might happen if the frontier should be closed and the "savage" element be permitted to dominate the "civilized," Slotkin shows the emergence by 1890 of a myth redefined to help Americans respond to the confusion and strife of industrialization and imperial expansion.</p></p><p><i>The Fatal Environment</i> is the second volume of Richard Slotkin's epochal study of the frontier myth in the cultural history of the United States. Like its predecessor, <i>Regeneration Through Violence</i>, the book discusses the archetype of the lone frontiersman/Indian hunter and how it has been used to rationalize the destructive excesses of American territorial expansion. Time and time again, the hunter/killer exerts a power over the wilderness that rests not upon the inherent superiority of his white civilization, but on the psychic absorption of the "barbaric" customs of the peoples on the uncharted landscape.<p> Slotkin begins by elaborating on the themes of the previous study, specifically showing how the mythic Indian fighter, who defined sectional interests in the decades prior to the Civil War, evolved into the frontier aristocrat, who not only possesses the virtues of the "leatherstocking" hero but also demonstrates the ability to lead men in erecting large-scale, technologically complex enterprises. Thus, Slotkin argues, popular imagery concerning the conquest of the West was made to reflect the interests of post-Civil War industrialized capitalism.</p><p> Custer's Last Stand epitomizes the transformation of the frontier hero from warrior to robber baron. In the book's most vivid chapter, Slotkin shows how the popular press turned the Boy General's defeat into a call not only for the destruction of the Plains Indians but for social controls over the immigrants who formed the emerging, potentially militant, urban proletariat. <i>The Fatal Environment</i> makes a compelling case that the culture of cowboy capitalism was steeped in the suppression of class conflict. <i>--John M. Anderson</i></p>The second volume in the award-winning trilogy that includes <i>Gunfighter Nation</i>, this important historical work examines the origins of the mythical American frontier and traces its development in the nineteenth century.</p><h2>Out of Sight, Out of Time (Gallagher Girls, 5)</h2><p>*&#x201c;This episode is nearly three hundred pages of perfection, and the only regret fans will have when they are done is being one step closer to the final installment of this outstanding series.&#x201d; <i>VOYA</i>&nbsp;[starred review]&nbsp;With more than a&nbsp;1.8 million&nbsp;Gallagher Girls books sold, a legion of fans have fallen in love with the <i>New York Times </i>best-selling spy-girl series, and the fifth book delivers the most nerve-wracking, high-stakes adventure yet.<br><br>The last thing Cammie Morgan remembers is leaving the Gallagher Academy to protect her friends and family from the Circle of Cavan an ancient terrorist organization that has been hunting her for over a year.

The letter told Bob&#x2019;s many human friends what they might not have known the surprising story of how he was once a ferocious, untrusting dog named Red, and how through sheer determination he changed completely to become Tom&#x2019;s best friend. Tom began receiving an outpouring of heartfelt responses to what he came to realize was actually a universal tale about the possibility of change and the transformational power of love. Friends and strangers urged him to bring the story to more people, and with a vision of how it might look, Tom designed this special book version of the letter.

Louis-Napoleon&#x2019;s achievements have been mixed and confusing, even to historians. He completely revolutionized the infrastructure of the state and the economy, but at the price of financial scandals of imperial proportions. In an age when &#x201c;colonialism&#x201d; was expanding, Louis-Napoleon&#x2019;s colonial designs were both praised by the emperor&#x2019;s party and the French military and resisted by the socialists.</p><p>He expanded the nation&#x2019;s railways to match those of England; created major new transoceanic steamship lines and a new modern navy; introduced a whole new banking sector supported by seemingly unlimited venture capital, while also empowering powerful new state and private banks; and completely rebuilt the heart of Paris, street by street.</p><p>Napoleon III wanted to surpass the legacy of his famous uncle, Napoleon I.

Yet perhaps the most compelling gangster tale is one that has been, until now, too well-hidden. This is the story of the Outfit: the secretive organized crime cartel that began its reign in prohibition-era Chicago before becoming the real puppet master of Hollywood, Las Vegas, and Washington D.C. </p><p><i>The Outfit</i> recounts the adventures and exploits of its bosses, Tony 'Joe Batters' Accardo (the real Godfather), Murray 'The Camel' or 'Curly' Humphreys (one of the greatest political fixers and union organizers this country has ever known), Paul 'The Waiter' Ricca, and Johnny Rosselli (the liaison between the shadowy world and the outside world). Their invisibility was their strength, and what kept their leader from ever spending a single night in jail. The Outfit bosses were the epitome of style and grace, moving effortlessly among national political figures and Hollywood studio heads-until their world started to crumble in the 1970s. </p><p>With extensive research including recently released FBI files, the Chicago Crime files of entertainer Steve Allen, first-ever access to the voluminous working papers of the Kefauver Committee, original interviews with the members of the Fourth Estate who pursued the Outfit for forty years, and exclusive access to the journals of Humphrey's widow, veteran journalist Gus Russo uncovers sixty years of corruption and influence, and examines the shadow history of the United States.</p></p><p><p><b>Gus Russo</b> is the author of <i>Live By the Sword: The Secret War Against Castro and the Death of JFK</i>. He is an investigative reporter who has worked for various major television networks, including PBS' <i>Frontline</i> series.</p>Investigative reporter Russo (Live by the Sword: The Secret War Against Castro and the Death of JFK) offers an impressive in-depth history of Chicago's elusive crime syndicate. Unlike their trigger-happy East Coast counterparts, Chicago's gangsters stressed businesslike discretion following the chaotic Capone era, and they had a wide-ranging impact on American culture, entertainment and politics that has never been fully documented. Russo has new sources, ranging from entertainer Steve Allen's "crime files" to the widow of the book's most memorable figure, the Outfit's financial manager, "Curly" Humphreys. Others, like Paul "The Waiter" Ricca, will be known to Mob aficionados, but even they will note Russo's novel thesis, that the lucrative scams carried out during the group's 40-year heyday involved members of the respected "upperworld." These ventures ranged from the well known, such as the gambling operations that fueled Chicago's civic corruption, to the surprising (Mob-linked dairies were the first to use "sell by" dates). The Outfit started off-track betting and Top 40 charts and, in its declining years, the Outfit's "fixer," Sidney Korshak, vetted the cast of The Godfather. According to Russo, their "respectable" partners who publicly abhorred the gangster element included Joe Kennedy, MCA president Jules Stein, Bing Crosby, Presidents Roosevelt and Truman, and innumerable public servants. Russo humanizes the shadowy gangsters without denying their violent proclivities. He also examines them in the context of traditional immigrant ambitions. Russo's illuminating history may disorient some readers; still, this is the book to beat in examining this midcentury criminal empire.

These conflicts were fought unsparingly between the nations of the islands -- Ireland, England, and Scotland -- and between parliament and the crown. Shattering the illusion of a "united kingdom," they cost hundreds of thousands of lives: a greater proportion of the population than died in the First World War.</p><p>When religious passion gave way to the equally consuming passion for profits, it became possible for the pieces of Britain to come together as the spectacularly successful business enterprise of "Britannia Incorporated." And in a few generations that business state expanded in a dizzying process that transformed what had been an obscure, off-shore footnote to Europe's great powers into the main event -- the most powerful empire in the world.</p><p>Yet somehow, it was the "wrong empire." The British considered it a bastion of liberty, yet it was based on military force and the enslavement of hundreds of thousands of Africans. In America, the emptiness of British claims to protect "freedom" was thrown back into the teeth of colonial governors and redcoat soldiers, while the likes of Sam Adams and George Washington inherited the mantle of Cromwell.</p><p>Simon Schama grippingly evokes the horror of the battle, famine, and plague; the flames of burning cities; the pathos of broken families, with fathers and sons forced to choose opposing sides. But he also captures the intimacies of palace and parliament and the seductions of profit and pleasure. Geniuses like John Milton, Thomas Hobbes, and Benjamin Franklin stalk vividly through his pages, but so do Scottish clansmen, women pamphleteers, and literate, eloquent African slaves like Olaudah Equiano.</p></p><p>The beginning of the 17th century promised that England's golden age would long outlast its Elizabethan namesake. Within a few years, that promise would end in civil war, political unrest, and international conflict, a period of strife that would last for two centuries, but produce the modern British nation. In this swiftly moving narrative, the second installment in a three- volume companion to the BBC/History Channel television series, Simon Schama examines key events that would utterly change British life: the collapse of monarchy and republic, the establishment of the beginnings of empire, and the ever-wider division between court and country. The wars that accompanied these turns of fortune were, Schama writes, "eminently unpredictable, improbable, and avoidable." With them came the Glorious Revolution, the bloody suppression of religious dissent, the conquest of neighboring kingdoms, and the wide-scale movement of large populations from one place to another--including the deliberate introduction of nearly 100,000 Scots, Welsh, and English settlers in Ireland, which, Schama writes, "utterly dwarfed the related 'planting' on the Atlantic seaboard of North America." Along the way, Schama considers actors major and minor in this tumultuous play, from the unlucky king Charles I to Oliver Cromwell (who "lacked the one essential characteristic for true dictatorship: a hunger to accumulate power purely for its own sake"), from the writer Daniel Defoe to the pragmatic politician Sir Robert Walpole, from William Pitt to the African slaves who peopled Britain's American colonies.<p> Though understandably rushed and sometimes unfocused, Schama's narrative ably captures Britain's transformation from island outpost to global power. <i>-- Gregory McNamee</i></p><b>Simon Schama</b> was born in London in 1945 and since 1966 has taught history and art history at Cambridge and Oxford and art history at Cambridge, Oxford, and Harvard.

We had always valued the history, the world of ideas contained between the covers of a book or, as in the case of <i>The Night Visitor, </i>some special personal significance. Now, for the first time, we began to appreciate that there was a history and a world of ideas embodied by the books themselves.<br></p><p>After years of competitive extravagance at birthday time, Lawrence and Nancy Goldstone decided to limit themselves to $20 each, which is how they came to be in possession of a $10 definitive translation of <i>War and Peace,</i> complete with maps of the major battles and fold-out color illustrations.

In 1866, twelve men and women and one small child were forced aboard a leaky schooner and cast away to a natural prison on the Hawaiian island of Molokai. Two weeks later, a dozen others were exiled, and then forty more, and then a hundred more. Tracked by bounty hunters and torn screaming from their families, the luckless were loaded into shipboard cattle stalls and abandoned in a lawless place where brutality held sway. Many did not have leprosy, and most of those who did were not contagious, yet all were caught in a shared nightmare. The colony had little food, little medicine, and very little hope. Exile continued for more than a century, the longest and deadliest instance of medical segregation in American history. Nearly nine thousand people were banished to the colony, trapped by pounding surf and armed guards and the highest sea cliffs in the world. Twenty-eight live there still. John Tayman tells the fantastic saga of this horrible and hopeful place -- at one time the most famous community in the world -- and of the individuals involved. From the very first exile -- a gentle part-time lawyer trapped in an unjust ordeal beyond his imagination -- to the last remaining residents, the narrative is peopled by presidents and kings, cruel lawmen and pioneering doctors, and brave souls who literally gave their lives to help. A stunning cast includes the martyred Father Damien, Robert Louis Stevenson, Jack London, Mark Twain, Teddy Roosevelt, John Wayne, and more. The result is a searing tale of survival and bravery, and a testament to the power of faith, compassion, and heroism.</p><p>John Tayman is the former deputy editor of Outside magazine. He has been editor-at-large for Men&#39;s Journal, executive editor of New England Monthly and contributing editor to Life, GQ, People, Men&#39;s Health, and Business 2.0.From 1866 to 1969, the remote island of Molokai was home to all Hawaiian leprosy patients. This chronological story follows the history of the institution from its shameful beginnings through its development into a decent medical facility by the tireless Father Damien. It is also a testament to human will--the stories of the patients are compelling. Patrick Lawlor is empathetic and clear, differentiating the narrative from the many quotations from diaries, letters, and interviews. He develops a myriad of realistic accents for a multitude of people, ranging from visiting Scotsman Robert Louis Stevenson, doctors from all over the world, and Flemish priests to dozens of Hawaiian patients.

Why did a particular piece move him? How did the music work? Over time, he realized that his passion for this music was not enough. He needed to understand it. Take Bach, for starters. Who was he? How does one account for his music and its unshakeable hold on us today? <br><br>As a critic, Tommasini has devoted particular attention to living composers and overlooked repertory. But, like all classical music lovers, the canon has remained central for him. In 2011, in his role as the Chief Classical Music Critic for the New York Times,&nbsp;he wrote a popular series in which he somewhat cheekily set out to determine the all-time top ten composers. Inviting input from readers, Tommasini wrestled with questions of greatness. Readers joined the exercise in droves. Some railed against classical music&#x2019;s obsession with greatness but then raged when Mahler was left off the final list. This intellectual game reminded them why they loved music in the first place. <br><br>Now in THE INDISPENSABLE COMPOSERS, Tommasini offers his own personal guide to the canon--and what greatness really means in classical music. What does it mean to be canonical now? Who gets to say? And do we have enough perspective on the 20th century to even begin assessing it? To make his case, Tommasini draws on elements of biography, the anxiety of influence, the composer's relationships with colleagues, and shifting attitudes toward a composer's work over time. Because he has spent his life contemplating these titans, Tommasini shares impressions from performances he has heard or given or moments when his own biography proves revealing. <br><br>As he argues for his particular pantheon of indispensable composers, Anthony Tommasini provides a masterclass in what to listen for and how to understand what music does to us.</p><p><b>Anthony Tommasini</b> is the chief classical music critic for the <i>New York Times</i>. He graduated from Yale University, and later earned a Doctorate of Musical Arts from Boston University.

In the wake of the Cancer Genome Atlas project's failure to provide a legible roadmap to a cure for cancer, science writer Travis Christofferson illuminates a promising blend of old and new perspectives on the disease. Tripping over the Truth follows the story of cancers proposed metabolic origin from the vaunted halls of the German scientific golden age, to modern laboratories around the world. The reader is taken on a journey through time and science that results in an unlikely connecting of the dots with profound therapeutic implications. Transporting us on a rich narrative of humanities struggle to understand the cellular events that conspire to form malignancy, it reads like a detective novel, full of twists and cover-ups, blind-alleys and striking moments of discovery by men and women with uncommon vision, grit and fortitude. Ultimately we arrive at a conclusion that challenges everything we thought we knew about the disease, suggesting the reason for the failed war against cancer stems from a flawed paradigm that categorizes cancer as an exclusively genetic disease.&nbsp;&nbsp;For anyone affected by this terrifying disease, and the physicians who struggle to treat it, Tripping&nbsp;Over the Truth&nbsp;provides a fresh and hopeful perspective. It explores the new and exciting non-toxic therapies born from the emerging metabolic theory of cancer. Therapies that may one day prove to be a turning point in the struggle against our ancient enemy. We are shown how the metabolic theory redraws the battle-map, directing researchers to approach cancer treatment from a different angle, framing it more like a gentle rehabilitation rather than all-out combat. In a sharp departure from the current "targeted" revolution occurring in cancer pharmaceuticals, the metabolic therapies highlighted have one striking feat</p><p><p>Travis Christofferson, M.S. received his undergraduate degree in molecular biology from the Montana State University Honors Program and a master&#x2019;s degree in Material Engineering and Science from the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology. Today, he is a full-time science writer and founder of a cancer charity. He lives in South Dakota.</p><p>"Travis Christofferson provides a compelling historical account of how cancer has been misunderstood as a genetic disease when, in fact, it is a type of metabolic disease.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike normal cells, which obtain their energy from respiration, cancer cells have damaged respiration and obtain much of their energy from the primitive process of fermentation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Travis describes how the mutations in tumors arise as an effect of respiratory damage and cannot be the cause or drivers of cancer. The information presented in&nbsp;<em>Tripping over the Truth&nbsp;</em>will have profound consequences for how cancer is managed and prevented.&nbsp;&nbsp;Metabolic therapies will be more effective and less toxic than the current gene- or immune-based therapies and have the potential to significantly improve quality of life and long-term survival for millions of cancer patients worldwide.&#x201d;<strong>--Thomas N.

Her work is waylaid by the arrival of three women&#x2014;Julia, Camille, and Susan&#x2014;all of whom have launched a recent and spontaneous friendship that will uproot them completely and redirect their lives. Susan, the most adventurous of the three, has enticed them to subvert expectations of staid retirement by taking a lease on a big, beautiful house in Tuscany. Though novices in a foreign culture, their renewed sense of adventure imbues each of them with a bright sense of bravery, a gusto for life, and a fierce determination to thrive. But how?

I&#x2019;d been reading in my garden for a couple of hours, taking a few notes and making black dots in the margins, a way to locate interesting sentences later without defacing the book. Around four thirty on these early darkening days, some impulse toward dinner quickens, and I began to consider the veal chops in the fridge and to think of cutting a bunch of the chard still rampaging through the orto. Chard with raisins, garlic, and orange peel. Thyme and parsley for the tiny potatoes Colin dug at the end of summer. Since the nights were turning chilly, I put down my book, grabbed the wood-carrier from the house, and walked out to the shed to fetch olive tree prunings for the fireplace grill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yet another escape. I am putting off writing about Margaret, my difficult and rigorous friend, whose writing I admired. Oh, still admire, but this project feels more like trying to strike mildewed matches&#x2014;I keep rereading instead of writing. I&#x2019;ve read her <i>Stairs to Palazzo del Drago</i> a dozen times.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A book can be a portal. Each one I&#x2019;ve written firmly sealed off one nautiline chamber (Is <i>nautiline</i> a word? Meaning pertaining to a nautilus?), and then opened into the next habitable space. Always before, my subjects chose me. I&#x2019;m the happy follower of fleeting images that race ahead, sometimes just out of sight, of lines that U-turn and break like the downside of heartbeats. Isn&#x2019;t <i>boustrophedo</i>n the ongoing form of writing that mimics the turns an ox makes when plowing a field?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At times, writing conflagrates, a vacant-lot fire started by bad boys. That&#x2019;s when I&#x2019;m elated. But this time, I chose my friend as the subject. I feel as I did in college, slugging out a research paper on &#x201c;The Concept of Time in T. S. Eliot&#x2019;s <i>Four Quartets</i>.&#x201d; I enjoyed the work but immediately felt humiliated by my limits.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I&#x2019;m easily distractible. Those shriveled apples on the third terrace, still golden and dangling as brightly as in the myth of the three graces, lure me to make a galette. Fitzy has burrs in his silky hair and needs brushing. My own hair has turned unruly. I would like to have a few friends over for polenta with mushrooms and sausage, now that the <i>funghi porcini</i> are sprouting under every oak tree. My mind surfs over endless diversions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When you&#x2019;re propelled by a sense of duty, you&#x2019;re easy to derail.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As I picked dried branches from the woodpile, I looked down from the upper olive terrace as Gianni, the local driver, turned sharply into the long drive of the Malpiedi place across the road, his white van crackling over dry stubble. Malpiedi&#x2014;Bad Feet. I&#x2019;ve always loved the Italian names that remind me of ones my friends and I adopted when we played Wild Indians in the vacant lot by my family&#x2019;s house in Coral Gables. Wandering Bear, Deer Heart, Straight Arrow. One friend chose Flushing Toilet. But here it&#x2019;s Bucaletto, Hole in the Bed; Zappini, Little Hoe; Tagliaferro, Iron Cutter; and stranger, Taglialagamba, He Cuts the Leg&#x2014;maybe a butcher specializing in leg of lamb? Cipollini, Little Onion; Tagliasopra, Cut Above; Bellocchio, Beautiful Eye&#x2014;how alive those names are.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Early in my years in Italy, fascinated by every syllable, I used to collect them. In hotels when there were telephone books, I&#x2019;d read the names at night for the pleasure of coming upon Caminomerde, Chimney Shit&#x2014;there&#x2019;s a story there&#x2014;and Pippisecca, Dry Pipe (or Penis); and Pescecane, Dog Fish. The sublime Botticelli? Little Barrel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Bad Feet were gone now. I attended the wake for Luisa, the wife, who had an erotically decorated cake at her last birthday&#x2014;figures like those feasting frescoes from Pompeii in the Naples museum, where the phallus is so large it&#x2019;s carried forth on a tray. Passing by their table in the restaurant where she was celebrating with friends, I was shocked to look down at the garish pink and green cake everyone was laughing over. After that, I was embarrassed when I saw plump, stoop-shouldered, rabbit-eyed Tito, her husband. She died of diverticulitis, some sudden rupture I couldn&#x2019;t help but think was caused by too much cake, and Tito followed all too shortly. He did choke, but on pork <i>arista</i>, with no one around to perform the Heimlich. I try not to imagine his rheumy eyes popping out of their sockets. The daughter, Grazia, who snorts then brays when she laughs, painted some rooms, put in a dishwasher, and listed the house for lease before she went to live with her failing aunt in town. (I later learned that the rental terms included an option to buy after one year.) Grazia was not coming back to rattle around in the big stone house that was cool in the summer and cool in the winter. I missed them as neighbors. I even missed the years of Grazia&#x2019;s squealing violin practice, Luisa&#x2019;s piano, and Tito&#x2019;s sax. Hours of sour notes wafting up the hill. We&#x2019;d lived parallel lives on the same slope for eleven years, and then within six months the house stood empty, with the kitchen shutter banging in the night when the <i>tramontana </i>blew in from the Alps.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I&#x2019;ve always loved their house&#x2014;its big square self, rooted firmly on a long flat spur of our terraced hillside, and the great <i>portone</i> with sphinx-face doorknockers popular from the time Italy was ransacking Egypt. Over the door, the fanlight&#x2019;s fanciful iron curls, twisted around the letter S, the initial, I suppose, of the person who built such a solid structure three hundred years ago. If you cut away the jasmine vines, you&#x2019;d see&nbsp;VIRET IN AETERNUM, It Flourishes Forever. A prideful motto. The house&#x2019;s name&#x2014;Villa Assunta. Perhaps it was finished around the holiday Ferragosto, when the Virgin Mary assumed into heaven. Six big square rooms up, six down. Afterthought bathrooms but okay.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I would sometimes take Tito and Luisa a basket of plums when my trees were dripping with them. As their door swung open, a splash of light pooled on the waxed bricks. At the end of the hall I saw the great large-paned window full of splayed green linden leaves, and in winter angular black limbs like a dashed-off charcoal sketch.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>DOWN IN THE OLIVE GROVE, I saw Gianni&#x2019;s van weave in and out of sight. Through silvery trees, glimpses of white, scree of trees, flash of white. He descended the rough drive, pulling into the weedy parking spot beside the house, where Luisa often used to leave her blue Fiat Cinquecento ragtop open to the rain. I always wanted to use that image in a poem but it never fit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Three women got out, hardly the three graces as they dragged carry-on bags and clumsy backpacks and totes. Gianni hauled out four mastodon-sized suitcases and struggled each one to the door. I couldn&#x2019;t hear the women, who appeared to be exclaiming and laughing. I supposed they were here for an autumn vacation. There&#x2019;s a certain kind of traveler who shuns the hectic summer months and arrives for the season of more solitude. I hoped they would not be noisy; sound travels in the hills. If their husbands are arriving and boozy dinners ensue, there could be chaos. Who are they? Not young. I could see that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My own arrival here, <i>Dio</i>&#x2014;twelve years ago, seems as vivid as yesterday. I stepped out of the car, looked up at the abandoned stone farmhouse, and I knew, what did I know? <i>This is it. This is</i> <i>where I invent the future.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>Could they be thinking the same? And Margaret, too, my subject, my lost friend, once arrived long, long before me at her golden stone house below the tower of Il Palazzone (big palazzo indeed), not knowing what life she might find. What she did find immediately was a huge, squealing pig left shut in the lower level by the farmers/former owners (peasants, she called them) as a gift.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Margaret was a firm exile, not like me, a come-and-go one, and in her embroidered slippers and Venetian black devor� velvet coat, nothing like these latest arrivals in magenta, orange, saffron puffy down jackets and boots.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The one in the electric magenta hoists a dog carrier out of the van&#x2019;s rear door. She kneels and releases a small toffee-colored yapper that starts up right away running in circles around all of them, almost lifting off the ground with joy. So, I guessed, since they&#x2019;ve brought a dog, they&#x2019;re not here for a brief holiday.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Gathering more fire starter, I fell into sort of a reverie. Their gestures and movements below me seemed suddenly distant, a static tableau. Some latter-day illustration for a medieval book of</p><p>hours: under a dapple-gray sky, the stalwart house catching late rays, stones gleaming as if covered with snail tracks; the windows&#x2019; mottled glass bouncing back the sunlight as mirror. Between Villa Assunta and me, elongated shadows of cypress trees stripe the village road. As if behind veils (for the afternoon light here turns to a pale, honeyed transparency), the slow-motion</p><p>women walk toward the door, where Gianni fumbles with the iron key that used to hang by a tattered orange ribbon on a hook inside the door. I knew they&#x2019;d soon inhale the old-book smell of the closed house. They&#x2019;d step in and see that hall window back-blazed with golden linden leaves, possibly would stop to take in a breath.<i> Oh, so that&#x2019;s where we are. </i>Why did tears sting my eyes?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, Luisa, you never did get that craggy mole taken off your chin, never even plucked the coarse spike of hair that I weirdly had the impulse to touch. Too late; you are gone (what, a year?), and Tito, too, with his huge phallus or not, his meek smile, and now almost totally erased are the many seasons in the great old <i>cucina</i> with a fireplace big enough to pull up a chair, pour a smidgen of <i>vin santo</i>, and tell stories of the war, when many local men walked home barefoot from Russia. That flaky Grazia could have had the yard cleared up a bit. All gone. <i>Gone with the Wind,</i> the book I devoured in my early teens. Still a great title. (Margaret also <i>via col</i> <i>vento</i>.) What a sharp writer, <i>la</i> Margherita. What glinting eyes. I used to study her clean, clipped prose style. I like to use <i>and</i> because for me everything connects. She never used<i> and</i> because for her, nothing connected. In writing, you can&#x2019;t hide who you are.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Over the years her work simply evaporated from public view, even <i>Sun Raining on Blue Flowers</i>, which had impressive critical attention and despite that still managed to appear on best-seller lists. Most of my writer friends never have heard of her. I feel compelled to reawaken interest in her few books, not that I have the power to secure her a place in the canon, if the canon even still exists.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>ARRIVALS. ALL POTENTIAL. I REMEMBER mine, the black iron key the real estate agent Pescecane (yes, Dogfish) handed over after I signed the last paper, me walking through the empty rooms&#x2014;counting them: eleven, most of them small. Four below once housed farm animals and still had enormous, smooth stone floors and a rime of fluffy white mold from uric acid. Upstairs the ceilings soared because there had been attics (long since collapsed) for grain and chestnut storage. I&#x2019;d forgotten the dank cantina tacked onto the long kitchen and dining room wing. I remember the creak of the latch, then pushing open the shutters, the view pouring in like grace received. Casa Fonte delle Foglie, fountain of leaves. Maybe that&#x2019;s why I fell for it, that poetic name scrawled on the oldest local maps. Apt for my leafy plot of olive, linden, ilex, and pine layered around a curve of hillside. I&#x2019;d only seen the inside once and didn&#x2019;t even remember the two upstairs fireplaces, or the sagging beam in the kitchen. Not mouse skeletons in the pantry. My house from the outset seemed mine. I literally rolled up my sleeves and set to work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What the three women are seeing now&#x2014;will it imprint forever, or will it slowly fade once the vacation ends? Like that house I rented one July in the Mugello north of Florence&#x2014;the vintage fridge formed such an igloo that the door wouldn&#x2019;t close. If you touched the handle you got an icy shock. I can&#x2019;t picture the bedrooms at all, but I remember decades-old Christmas cards and</p><p>christening invitations in the sideboard drawer. Memory has shut the doors all the way down a long hall. Only one stands open at the end, an empty white room with white pigeon dung in a line on the floor under a rafter. Who snatches up their roots and roosts in a foreign country where they have no people? I did. Margaret&#x2014;well, she was born to roam. &#x201c;Now you can never go home,&#x201d; she used to threaten.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But you can go home; it&#x2019;s not drastic, that is until you&#x2019;re not sure where home is. How many hopefuls have I seen arrive and begin life here only to wake up one day&#x2014;after the restoration, after the Italian class<i> (I thought Italian was supposed to be easy</i>), after the well gone dry, after the boozy lunch-after-lunch with others who speak little Italian, after stone-cold winter&#x2014;and</p><p>think, <i>What in hell am I doing here?</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>Even so, powerful propulsions drive us. Drove Margaret, drove me. In the Florence train station, arrival signs flash right next to the enticing departures. <i>Treni in arrivi, treni in partenze,</i> one suggesting the other. (I still want to board every one.) Margaret abandoned her Casa Gelsomino, Jasmine House. Long her destiny, then not. Two summers she returned, staying with us. By that time, she was critical of Italy, and one night when her patience snapped she said to me, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re like a child. Na�f. Perpetually astonished.&#x201d; I said nothing. She&#x2019;d ripped into me once before.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Colin chided her. &#x201c;Oh, Margaret, you know that&#x2019;s bullshit. Kit sees all.&#x201d; And he poured her a shot of grappa to end the evening.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Italy&#x2019;s an old country. That, at least, you know. Babies are born old here. That you don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; She threw back the grappa in a gulp, looked wide-eyed for a moment, and said, &#x201c;<i>Buona notte</i>.&#x201d; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And these three, just choosing their bedrooms and flinging their luggage on the bed, just noticing that these Tuscan manses have no closets, just a cavernous, creaky <i>armadio in each room</i>. What</p><p>brings them to Luisa&#x2019;s stern villa? Is the end of their story already embedded in the beginning? Eliot&#x2019;s <i>in the beginning is my end</i> exasperated me as a college junior. How dreary, I thought then, but now, I do wonder, when and how will my time here come to an end? Fate, too propitious a word&#x2014;but what red thread connects an unforeseeable end to the day I arrived in a white sundress, opened the door, threw up my arms, twirled around&#x2014;to the surprise of the agent&#x2014;and shouted, <i>I&#x2019;m home.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>WALKING TO THE HOUSE, BASKET of sticks in hand, last rays of sun exploding in molten splotches on the lakes out in the valley, an armful of chard, sprigs of thyme and rosemary in my pocket, Colin waving from the front door, Fitzy springing after a copper leaf spiraling toward the grass, <i>Stairs to Palazzo del Drago</i> left on a lawn chair, Gianni beeping, mouthing <i>buona sera, signora</i> as his van freed of passengers speeds by, a little music&#x2014;Lucio Dalla?&#x2014;drifting from my house, there, like that, the subject chose me.</p></p><h2>American Horticultural Society Pests and Diseases: The Complete Guide to Preventing, Identifying and Treating Plant Problems</h2><p>The American Horticultural Society presents a richly illustrated primer on the identification, treatment, and prevention of a wide range of gardening pests and diseases, featuring more than three hundred full-color photographs and captions that describe symptoms and causes, information on a broad spectrum of organic and biological treatment methods, and prevention tips.</p><p>Is your garden troubled by cutworms or aphids? Need to know the best method for preventing the spread of viruses among your houseplants? Look no further than <i>Pests and Diseases</i>, the informative guide to the downside of gardening. Sooner or later, everyone's roses are troubled by black spot. Or maybe you haven't been having success treating known problems with chemical solutions. <i>Pests and Diseases</i> will answer all your questions, from prevention methods to lasting damage repair.<p> The close-up photos in the "identifying" area are certainly helpful, but are not for the squeamish. And it's not just the creepy crawlies that are a little discomforting--shots of full-blown bacterial infections on tree trunks aren't exactly a welcome sight, either. But to ensure healthy lives for their plants, responsible gardeners need to be as familiar with ladybug larvae as they are with lavender. It's better to recognize these problems in the early stages. Treatments discussed focus on organic and biological methods whenever possible. Beer-traps, barriers, and beneficial bugs are all explained in detail, along with reminders that regular weeding and cleanliness aren't just for looks, but for health as well. When chemical solutions are recommended, proper care is emphasized--not just for you, but for the other plants and animals in your garden. Proper techniques for preparation, treatment, storage, and disposal are gone over at length, as well as stern advice to only use these in moderation, and correctly--if they won't solve the problem thoroughly, then they're not worth the risks involved. Thorough and straightforwardly technical, even beginning gardeners will find it possible to tackle tough problems with this intelligent aid. <i>--Jill Lightner</i></p>Pippa Greenwood is widely recognized as an authority on plant problems and gardening.

Sixth in the author's Winning of America series, the book focuses on how the whites took North America from the Indians. Eckert chronicles the Black Hawk War of 1832, fought for possession of the rich farmland of the upper Mississippi Valley. Most of the action took place in Illinois and Wisconsin, where both the U.S. Army and local militias were involved in scattered skirmishes for four months. Gen. Winfield Scott was delayed because of an outbreak of cholera, but Col. Zachary Taylor and Lt. Jefferson Davis were present, as was Pvt. Abraham Lincoln of the Illinois militia. We meet the Sac leaders, Black Hawk and Keokuk (loyal to the U.S.), and the treacherous Winnebago chief, White Crow, who played both sides. Eckert has used primary sourcespersonal letters, military correspondence, tribal historiesfor a memorable excursion into a dark chapter of our history. In the final battle, at Bad Axe, 21 soldiers and 350 Indians were killed.

Kerr, he is the author of the much-loved young adult series Children of the Lamp. He lives in London.</p>After a 15-year hiatus during which he's taken readers from the Himalayan snows to Enlightenment England, Kerr returns to the war-torn Germany of his Berlin Noir trilogy with a fourth case for sardonic detective Bernhard Gunther. It is 1949, and fed up with trying to run a hotel next door to Dachau, Gunther hangs out his shingle and in walks a tall blond with marriage on her mind and a missing husband on her conscience. Gunther sets out to track down the renowned sadist, one of many SS spiders able to slip through the Allies' dragnet and find refuge in the Americas. Of course, nothing is quite as it seems, and our knight's detached weltschmerz gets a fresh coat of tarnish. As with his earlier Gunther books, Kerr follows Raymond Chandler's playbook closely, adapting his trademark metaphors with all the subtlety of a goose-step and the restraint of Hermann Goring at a knackwurst-eating contest, to say nothing of the relish. Still, the knockabout action should please most fans of classic hard-boiled mystery and historical espionage. <i>David Wright</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Here, Bird (a contributing editor of The Nation) fills this void with an evenhanded and wonderfully readable account of the public man that also sheds light on the meritocracy whose dedication to principles beyond partisanship still gives it incalculable influence over a presumptively democratic polity. An ambitious, industrious overachiever who made his way from the wrong side of the tracks in Philadelphia through Amherst and Harvard Law School to international eminence, McCloy was notable more for analytic acuity than great brilliance. The upwardly mobile attorney nonetheless left his mark wherever he went. During WW II, for example, the globe-trotting McCloy was Henry Stimson's top aide at the War Department. He later headed the World Bank during its formative years and was High Commissioner of occupied Germany, moving on to the chairmanship of Chase Manhattan. Though a staunch Republican, he served as an advisor to JFK, LBJ, and their successors, while remaining a leading light of the Council on Foreign Relations--an establishment citadel if ever there was one. Although a pillar of rectitude, the pragmatic McCloy did not eschew expedients. He played a key role in the internment of Japanese- Americans after Pearl Harbor, for instance, and granted clemency to scores of convicted Nazis during his tenure in Berlin. When he died early in 1989, a few weeks short of 94, however, McCloy was fittingly eulogized for his substantive contributions to the public good. An impressive narrative history that records a consequential individual's shortcomings without tarnishing his accomplishments. Despite a paucity of personal detail, the absorbing text (ten years in preparation) will likely be the definitive life story for decades to come. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

But recently, Nussbaum argues, thinking about the aims of education has gone disturbingly awry in the United States and abroad. We increasingly treat education as though its primary goal were to teach students to be economically productive rather than to think critically and become knowledgeable and empathetic citizens. This shortsighted focus on profitable skills has eroded our ability to criticize authority, reduced our sympathy with the marginalized and different, and damaged our competence to deal with complex global problems. And the loss of these basic capacities jeopardizes the health of democracies and the hope of a decent world.</p><p> In response to this dire situation, Nussbaum argues that we must resist efforts to reduce education to a tool of the gross national product. Rather, we must work to reconnect education to the humanities in order to give students the capacity to be true democratic citizens of their countries and the world.</p><p> Drawing on the stories of troubling--and hopeful--educational developments from around the world, Nussbaum offers a manifesto that should be a rallying cry for anyone who cares about the deepest purposes of education.</p></p><p><p>"Martha Nussbaum is the most erudite and visionary scholar writing on higher education today. Once again, she has laid out a novel and compelling argument with all of the clarity and rigor we expect from her writing.<i>Not for Profit</i> reminds us all that the deeper purposes of liberal education go well beyond personal advancement or national competitiveness. The real project is to educate responsible global citizens who will champion democracy and human development, and who have the skills to collaborate across differences and borders to solve pressing global problems."<b>--Grant H. Cornwell, president of the College of Wooster</b></p><p>"This book could not be more timely nor more on target. Martha Nussbaum argues that education has become increasingly utilitarian, market-driven, career-oriented, and impoverished in its attention to the arts and humanities. The arts and humanities don't necessarily make people humane and creative, but they are, Nussbaum argues, required for Socratic examination and self-examination. If we agree with Socrates that the unexamined life is not worth living, then we need Nussbaum's argument."<b>--Peter Brooks, Princeton University</b></p><p>"This is an important book and a superb piece of writing, combining passionate enthusiasm with calm arguments and informative examples. Written with a lovely light touch, it introduces the reader to the much misunderstood history of progressive education and shows its contemporary relevance."<b>--Harry Brighouse, University of Wisconsin-Madison</b></p><b>Martha C.

Wherever we&#x2019;ve traveled, they&#x2019;ve traveled, too. Yet we hardly know them, not even the ones we&#x2019;re closest to: those that eat our food, share our beds, and live in our homes. <br>&nbsp;<br>Organizing his book alphabetically with one entry for each letter, weaving together brief vignettes, meditations, and extended essays, Hugh Raffles embarks on a mesmerizing exploration of history and science, anthropology and travel, economics, philosophy, and popular culture to show us how insects have triggered our obsessions, stirred our passions, and beguiled our imaginations. <br>&nbsp;<br>Raffles offers us a glimpse into the high-stakes world of Chinese cricket fighting, the deceptive courtship rites of the dance fly, the intriguing possibilities of queer insect sex, the vital and vicious role locusts play in the famines of west Africa, how beetles deformed by Chernobyl inspired art, and how our desire and disgust for insects has prompted our own aberrant behavior. <br>&nbsp;<br>Deftly fusing the literary and the scientific, Hugh Raffles has given us an essential book of reference that is also a fascination of the highest order.<br><br>http://insectopedia.org/</p><p><strong>Neil Shubin Reviews <em>Insectopedia</em></strong> <br> <br> <strong>Neil Shubin is provost of The Field Museum as well as professor of anatomy at the University of Chicago, where he also serves as an associate dean. Educated at Columbia, Harvard, and the University of California at Berkeley, he lives in Chicago and is the author of the national bestseller, <em>Your Inner Fish</em>. Read Shubin's guest review of <em>Insectopedia</em>:</strong> <br> <p> </p> <p><em>Insectopedia</em> is one of the most remarkable books I have read in a long time. Like its subject, it is many things, all of them fascinating. First, it is a reference book of the first order: it is loaded with facts--some profound, others curious, and still others laugh-out-loud funny. <em>Insectopedia</em> is also part personal memoir, scientific detective story, and even cultural study. We travel the Amazon, visit Chernobyl, and enter laboratories and sidewalk cafes in search of insects and the ideas and cultures they inspire. Insects stir eerie fascination: they are beautiful, disgusting, important, and annoying. To some they are tasty. To others they are a source of sexual fetish. Who knew? In Raffles's hands insects become windows into our culture, science, health--even our psyche. In each page of <em>Insectopedia</em>, the more we learn of insects, the more we come to face--and sometimes even challenge--our own views of the world.</p> <p>Hugh Raffles's work stands alone for what it says both about its subject and about us. After reading <em>Insectopedia</em>, it's hard to look at a cricket, a bumblebee, and a human being the same way ever again. I adored the book. What an accomplishment. And I thought I knew insects... <em>--Neil Shubin</em></p> <strong><br>A Q&amp;A with Hugh Raffles</strong> <br> <p> <strong>Question:</strong> You&#x2019;re an anthropologist who has written about life in the Brazilian Amazon in <em>In Amazonia: A Natural History</em>. Why insects for this book? Have you always been fascinated by insects and people&#x2019;s interactions with them?</p> <p><strong>Hugh Raffles:</strong> Actually, no! But since I started researching this book a few years ago, I&#x2019;ve become completely obsessed by insects and our relationships with them. Now they seem like the most amazing creatures. But before that, they were around me but weren&#x2019;t something I paid that much attention to unless they were biting me or invading my apartment.</p> <p>For a long time though, I&#x2019;ve been interested in the connections between people and animals of all types. And I&#x2019;ve thought a lot about what other worlds exist alongside the ones that we people live in. Most of these worlds are invisible to us. To give an example: we usually assume that time is a universal measure that everyone experiences in more or less similar ways. But it seems likely that other animals&#x2019; experience of time is completely different from ours--that for them, their short lives might actually last a very long time.</p> <p>Despite the complexity of our own reality, it&#x2019;s quite a limited universe when we consider all the parallel realities within which other beings exist. Insects are fascinating because they&#x2019;re so different from us. It&#x2019;s almost impossible to imagine what the worlds they live in are like. Recreating those worlds is one of the things I try to do in <em>The Illustrated Insectopedia</em>, often by meeting people (artists, musicians, and scientists, for example) who have their own interesting ways of thinking about this.</p> <p><strong>Question:</strong> How did you decide on this encyclopedic format of A to Z? Did that seem a natural order after you wrote the essays or did you plan that from the beginning?</p> <p><strong>Hugh Raffles:</strong> I&#x2019;m one of those people who&#x2019;s interested in pretty much everything. After spending a long time writing a book about one small community in the Brazilian Amazon, I wanted a project that would give me the freedom to find out about as many things as possible. The form of an encyclopedia seemed perfect for that. Now, I also realize that the insects pushed me in this direction: there are so many of them and so many different species, they&#x2019;re everywhere and they won&#x2019;t stay still--the book needed a structure that would capture some of that energy.</p> <p>There were two other reasons for the A to Z. One was that, much as I like encyclopedias, I also wanted to make fun of them--the vanity of the idea that it&#x2019;s possible to know everything, and then possible to collect all that knowledge in one place. My entries are a little arbitrary, but then, so are the entries in a real encyclopedia when you compare them with all the possible information that could be included.</p> <p>The second reason was that I wanted to find out what it would be like to write with such a constraining form. It was tough! In fact, it was exhausting to be locked into 26 entries. There was a long period when I&#x2019;d already written enough chapters for a whole book but still wasn&#x2019;t even halfway through the alphabet. I&#x2019;d say there were a couple of years when I lost hope that I&#x2019;d ever get the thing finished. But on the other hand, there&#x2019;s no doubt that the alphabet pushed me to be more creative than I would have been otherwise--and it let me experiment with writing essays of different lengths and different styles. And it was fun--it encouraged me to be playful, which is always good!</p> <p><strong>Question:</strong> How did you research topics in this book? What led you from one topic to the next?</p> <p><strong>Hugh Raffles:</strong> I started working on this book back in 2003 and since then I&#x2019;ve been constantly on the lookout for interesting stories and situations about insects. Lots of people sent me ideas and I built up a collection of possible topics. I wanted an "encyclopedic" spread of chapters--a wide range across history and geography. And, in fact, the book visits 11th century Japan, 16th century Prague, 19th century France, modern-day China, Niger, and Florence, among many other times and places.</p> <p>I was especially interested in situations in which people and insects encountered each other in such a way that the superiority of human beings was no longer certain. I looked for situations in which the meeting between people and insects led to the person discovering something new about themselves, about his or her relationship to other beings, and about what it means to be human. I&#x2019;d like to say that the insects had some kind of experience in these encounters too, but I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ve managed to figure that out yet!</p> <p><strong>Question:</strong> What was the most bizarre thing you discovered about people and insects? How about the most universal thing?</p> <p><strong>Hugh Raffles:</strong> The most bizarre thing? Well, it&#x2019;s probably the most universal thing too. The more I&#x2019;ve learned about insects and the more amazing they&#x2019;ve become to me, the more strange it seems that we kill them without the least thought. Elias Canetti said that insects are "outlaws" because they are the only living beings which we kill with absolutely no moral qualms--think of Obama and the fly he swatted during that CNBC interview. What did he say? Something like "Got you, sucker!" That seems pretty bizarre to me and, unfortunately, more or less universal!</p> <p>(Photo � Michael Lionstar)</p><b>HUGH RAFFLES</b> teaches anthropology at The New School.

Illustrated throughout, it will appeal to the vast audience for revisionist archaeology and history as well as to the many Christian and Jewish readers who accept the historical validity of the Bible. Pharaohs and Kings was made into a highly acclaimed television series produced by The Learning Channel.</p><p>David Rohl is currently Chairman of the Institute for the Study of Interdisciplinary Sciences.British Egyptologist Rohl has produced a sumptuous popular summary of his ten-year "search for historical truth." Claiming no religious presuppositions, he has made a strong defense of the historicity of the Hebrew Bible by radically revising the traditional Egyptian chronology from the Middle Kingdom until the sacking of Thebes in 664 B.C. His "new chronology," combined with his new identifications of a few pharaohs encountered by the Hebrews, leads to the correlation of Saul and David with the Amarna period of Pharaoh Akhenaton and the dating of the Exodus to the reign of Rameses II. The new Exodus date produces a close correlation to the cultural conditions and destruction levels in Palestine. This is an excellent introduction to a topic that will surely be debated in the scholarly literature. Including end notes and an extensive bibliography for the reader who can handle the literature, the book is enhanced by exceptionally clear, helpful black-and-white photos; three groupings of color plates; numerous clear maps, charts, and diagrams; and an excellent glossary.

Along the way, she manages to cure her sickly cousin Colin, who is every bit as imperious as she. These two are sullen little peas in a pod, closed up in a gloomy old manor on the Yorkshire moors of England, until a locked-up garden captures their imaginations and puts the blush of a wild rose in their cheeks; "It was the sweetest, most mysterious-looking place any one could imagine. The high walls which shut it in were covered with the leafless stems of roses which were so thick, that they matted together.... 'No wonder it is still,' Mary whispered. 'I am the first person who has spoken here for ten years.'" As new life sprouts from the earth, Mary and Colin's sour natures begin to sweeten. For anyone who has ever felt afraid to live and love, <i>The Secret Garden</i>'s portrayal of reawakening spirits will thrill and rejuvenate. Frances Hodgson Burnett creates characters so strong and distinct, young readers continue to identify with them even 85 years after they were conceived. <i>(Ages 9 to 12)</i>What secrets lie behind the doors at Misselthwaite manor? Recently arrived at her uncle's estate, orphaned mary Lennox is spoiled, sickly, and certain she won't enjoy living there. Then she discovers the arched doorway into an overgrown garden, shut up since the death of her aunt ten years earlier. Mary soon begins transforming it into a thing of beauty--unaware that she is changing too.<p></p><p>But Missalthwaite hides another secret, as Mary discovers one night. High in a dark room, away from the rest of the house, lies her young cousin Colin, who believes he is an incurable invalid, destined to die young. His tantrums are so frightful, no one can reason with him. If only, Mary hopes, she can get Colin to love the secret garden as much as she does, its magic wil work wonders on him.</p></p><h2>Seidel&#39;s Guide to Physical Examination: An Interprofessional Approach (Mosby&#39;s Guide to Physical Examination)</h2><p><p>With a strong patient-centered approach to care and an author team comprised of nurses and physicians, <b>Seidel&#x2019;s Guide to Physical Examination, 8th Edition</b>, addresses teaching and learning health assessment in nursing, medical, and a wide variety of other health-care programs, at both undergraduate and graduate levels.

As a result of one final effort to recover, he crossed paths with two brilliant Chicago-area research-clinicians&#x2014;one an optometrist emphasizing neurodevelopmental techniques, the other a cognitive psychologist&#x2014;working on the leading edge of brain plasticity.

Observing him through my glass front door, I saw that it took him two minutes just to find the doorknob with his hand. When I gave him the simplest of my assessment tests&#x2014;copying a geometric line drawing&#x2014;his body went into bizarre contortions as he struggled to complete it. It hurt me to watch this brilliant man put so much effort into such a trivial task. In my decades-long practice in clinically applied neuroscience (CAN), this case was striking. During the two-hour evaluation session, I kept asking myself, &#x201c;What could have happened in the car accident eight years ago that all of these top medical doctors have missed?&#x201d; In thinking over my plan for rewiring his brain, I realized that most of Clark&#x2019;s cognitive and motor behaviors were likely tied to stress on his visual systems, and I wanted him to work in parallel with my highly esteemed colleague the optometrist Deborah Zelinsky, whom he went to see the following week.</p><p>Clark was an ideal client. He understood the complexity of the brain and the relationship between sensory input and behavior. And he was compliant, faithfully completing the rigorous cognitive exercises that I created for him&#x2014;the brain puzzles he was to solve on a daily basis. Most important, he carefully documented his behavioral changes so that I could move him quickly through the exercises that would allow him to regain control of his personal and professional life.</p><p>Clark&#x2019;s story is remarkable. Through his scrupulously documented recovery, he gives a voice and provides hope to millions of people, referred to as the <i>walking wounded</i>, with mild to moderate traumatic brain injury. The plasticity of the human brain is both its power and its weakness. Although the life-sustaining parts of the human brain are &#x201c;hardwired,&#x201d; the cognitive parts (located in the neocortex) are not. The part of the brain that allows people to think, to plan, to hope, to dream, to understand language and math, and to recognize themselves and others, is highly malleable.</p><p>This plasticity allows people to change their minds and to control their behavior, but it is also this part that suffers the greatest loss from brain injury. Much to the frustration of doctors and patients alike, cellular damage is microscopic and may be diffuse throughout the brain so that conventional scanning technologies cannot detect it.</p><p>By the time high-functioning individuals with post-traumatic head injury notice that their memories are not what they used to be, or that they have difficulty thinking through a problem they could once have easily solved, massive brain damage has occurred on a microscopic level. Because their symptoms are medically unverifiable and therefore untreatable, they are usually dismissed as the walking wounded, destined to suffer the pain, frustration, and humiliation of not knowing how much longer their condition will last or how much worse it will become. The <i>Designs for Strong Minds</i> system I have developed to treat such clients who come to me is a program based on a neurocognitive model that relies on the brain&#x2019;s plastic, reconfigurable nature, and uses <i>attention, intention, </i>and<i> rehearsal</i> to implement learning and behavioral change.</p><p>It is important to give credit to two individuals who contributed to Clark&#x2019;s cognitive restructuring success. Professor Reuven Feuerstein in 1981 introduced me to the original theoretical framework and the system that are the basis of my work, where the tools are <i>context-free visual puzzles</i> organized by logical structure, and the technique is <i>mediation,</i> to change the structure of the brain. It is from Professor Feuerstein that I learned &#x201c;Intelligence is plastic.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Cognition is modifiable at any age.&#x201d; And Christine Williams of NASA provided me with the opportunity to work with our top scientists, engineers, physicists&#x2014;literally our rocket scientists&#x2014;from 1998 to 2005. The tools, more than three thousand paper-and-pencil instruments that I created for NASA (joined by almost ten thousand instruments for children), became the framework, the structure, and the workbooks for Clark to regain his high-level cognitive functioning skills.</p><p>Warm regards,</p><p>Donalee Markus</p><p>www.designsforstrongminds.com</p><p></p><p></p><p>FOREWORD</p><p>After a car accident disrupted his brain function, Clark Elliott embarked on a long and difficult journey to regain mental and physical capacities. His recovery testifies to his own determination, and also to new therapeutic techniques developed by Dr. Markus and myself. At one level, Clark&#x2019;s story stands out because of his tenacity in pushing through successive phases of recuperation. At another, it supports the concept that visual inputs can affect brain function, which in turn can promote better coordination between brain and body systems. This theme that eyeglasses and mental activity can alter brain function, and brain function alters body function, remains at the forefront during the entire book and is very eye-opening to read.</p><p>Central eyesight, which allows us to &#x201c;see&#x201d; an object, is the last and slowest visual pathway to be activated during processing and yet, mistakenly, the most common way of evaluating visual function. Other pathways include peripheral eyesight that allows the brain to set a context for such objects, and many non-image-forming retinal pathways that link the external environment to internal systems that control sentience and metabolism. This last group of pathways is routed beneath conscious awareness directly from the retina to the body and affects such critical systems as balance, posture, hormones, neurotransmitters, circadian rhythms, etc. The interaction of all the non-image-forming signaling pathways modulates peripheral eyesight, and in turn the efficiency of central eyesight. Brain trauma such as that which Clark suffered often wreaks havoc on the balance of these three main visual systems.</p><p>My work in the field of neuro-optometric rehabilitation is based on the original ideas of Harry Riley Spitler and A. M. Skeffington, in the 1920s and &#x2019;30s respectively. Spitler observed that specific color frequencies affected body function, and Skeffington noted that some people could see targets clearly, yet remained visually uncomfortable, often rejecting glasses and preferring to have blurry eyesight. This line of thinking that the eye has connections with both the body and the mind was advanced further by notable optometric contributors including Gerald Getman, who identified links between visual processing and motor development, and Harry Wachs, who used Piaget&#x2019;s concepts to link academic development in the mind with motor stimulation of the body. In the 1980s, optometrists Bruce Wolff and John Thomas used the image of an eye being one of many doorways into brain function, having entrances and exits to synchronized, multisensory processing. In the 1990s my mentor, Albert A. Sutton, taught me never to think of the eye in isolation. A decade later, Selwyn Super&#x2019;s fascinating book on the differences between intention, attention, and inattention helped me to solidify rehabilitative concepts. As of 2014, more than 125 European doctors are expanding their thinking to include eye/ear interactions that can be affected by glasses, based on the ideas behind my patented Z-Bell&#x2122; diagnostic system.*</p><p>One outgrowth of these decades of clinical research has been the intentional use of therapeutic glasses to break old neurological habits, allowing new habits to develop beneath conscious awareness. Neuro-optometric rehabilitation, using customized lenses, can often help patients with different kinds of injuries recover from such lingering symptoms as difficulties with balance, motor control, seizure activity, and executive functioning. Thousands of articles on retinal circuitry&#x2014;linking modern neuroscience with optometry&#x2014;describe the pervasive integration of brain and body systems. At the heart of neuro-optometric rehabilitation is how such research can improve the lives of patients. Babak Kateb, M.D., another visionary, founded the World Brain Mapping Association based on the interdisciplinary concepts of translational medicine. At the association&#x2019;s international meeting this year, neuro-optometry will be one of the featured tracks, because contemporary retinal research has clearly demonstrated how optometry can profoundly affect brain and body functions.</p><p>Clark&#x2019;s amazing saga was written on the basis of his meticulous notes from the moment of his brain trauma until his remarkable recovery almost a decade later. He documents not only the intricate balance between visual/spatial processing and cognition that makes us human, but also the arduous passage from one stage of recuperation to another. As readers follow his story, it is hoped that they will gain a greater understanding of how the mind-eye connection is much more than meets the eye, and how people with many types of brain problems can be helped by carefully prescribed, nontraditional eyeglasses.</p><p>Deborah Zelinsky</p><p>www.mindeyeconnection.com</p><p></p><p></p><p>AUTHOR&#x2019;S NOTE</p><p>This book is intended for those who have suffered from a brain injury and know it, for those who have suffered a brain injury and will not know it until they recognize aspects of their lives in these pages, for those who have family members or friends who have suffered a brain injury, and for those who are simply interested in the magnificent inner workings of the most powerful computing device on earth: the human brain.</p><p>Stories of my fellow concussion survivors have flooded the media in recent years: returning combat veterans who have suffered traumatic brain injury (TBI), professional athletes who are demanding accountability from sports leagues and helmet makers, and some of our country&#x2019;s youth who have suffered troubling sports concussions. Given the <i>millions</i> of TBIs that are even reported each year in the United States alone, this is, yes, a quiet plague of epidemic proportions. Yet our society is only grudgingly coming to recognize that concussions are serious and life-changing injuries that may have lingering, undiagnosed symptoms such as emotional difficulties, fatigue, learning problems, and social problems that can last a lifetime.</p><p>In my experience, the medical community&#x2019;s standard of care for certain classes of TBIs has not yet caught up with effective new treatments that are available. There are many excellent physicians who have been exposed to current research in &#x201c;brain plasticity&#x201d; (wherein parts of the brain can be trained to compensate for other, injured parts), especially those physicians working with sports and military head injuries. However, it is unfortunately true that many M.D.s, including leading neurologists&#x2014;as well as putative leading rehabilitation institutions&#x2014;are as of the time of this writing unwittingly out of date when it comes to accurately diagnosing and treating concussion. This is unspeakably sad for those who are needlessly suffering and believe they have nowhere to turn.</p><p>The later chapters of this book that cover the science behind my recovery may also be highly revealing for those who suspect that they suffer from some form of attention difficulty, such as ADD, or suspect that a family member does. In the process of my recovery I realized that many of the features of such attention difficulties significantly overlap with those manifesting as concussion symptoms. From the many anecdotes I&#x2019;ve heard from my university students, and others, I think we should be highly suspicious that some of these attention difficulties are rooted in prior, sometimes even mild, head injuries. How many times have I heard, &#x201c;Oh, yes&#x2014;now that you ask, I did start having this trouble last year after I had that [car accident / skiing mishap / skateboard fall / soccer concussion].&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>The small changes that can occur in one&#x2019;s brain from even a quite forgettable bump on the head can masquerade in subtle ways such as personality oddities, trouble with multitasking, sleep disturbances, and even just growing old. Who would have thought to consider that slip on an icy doorstep five years ago as the culprit behind having a slight sense of being out of sync at unpredictable times, or having trouble managing appointments?</p><p>As a professor of artificial intelligence and cognitive science, I have shared some of the concepts covered in this book about how brains work with my classes, including the ideas behind several leading-edge cognitive restructuring, and neuro-optometric, treatments. It has been striking that I have never failed to have, in each such course, at least two students talk to me after class about their extreme interest in the material because of their own information-processing difficulties. This suggests to me that the kinds of brain difficulties experienced by <i>concussives</i> (as in, those who have suffered concussions)&#x2014;albeit in much milder forms than my own&#x2014;are far more widespread than we might traditionally suspect, especially among high-functioning, intelligent people who are very good at masking such problems.</p><p>One of the things concussives share is the feeling of having become an alien being. We still walk and talk and act as though we are part of the human race, but it doesn&#x2019;t feel that way inside. Essential parts of our brains that convey what it means to be fully human have disappeared&#x2014;vanished in that moment of impact when we tripped on the stairs, or crashed into an arena wall. Instead there is a strange feeling of nostalgia, a longing for who we used to be.</p><p><i>Normals</i>&#x2014;those who haven&#x2019;t suffered from concussions&#x2014;will take for granted the countless small operations their brains perform as they think and gracefully move their bodies through the day. But a concussive loses the ability to manage the staggering complexity of the systems that implement these operations, and as a result loses not only basic cognitive and motor functions, but also a larger sense of self-identity, and identity in relation to the world. This makes us odd beasts&#x2014;a cross between what amputees may experience with phantom limb syndrome, and what <i>hemispatial neglect</i> patients have when they suddenly lose half of their world: On the one hand, with a phantom limb, amputees are constantly reminded of what they used to be, of being whole. On the other hand, neglect patients are missing part of themselves and their world, and while they feel a sense of loss, they can no longer even imagine what it is they are missing. For a long time I lived in such a dual-natured limbo.</p><p>This book captures my harrowing yet ultimately fascinating odyssey as a concussive. For almost a decade, and even while struggling mightily&#x2014;sometimes just to get through a doorway, or down a flight of stairs&#x2014;I was constantly observing, analyzing, and recording the events unfolding in my life, and the ways in which my damaged brain was trying to make sense of them. I took twelve hundred pages of notes, and through them I became the subject of my own long-range experiment in cognition&#x2014;exploring the relationship between mind and body, and the inner mind and outer world. Along the way I learned a great deal about how the <i>healthy</i> human brain works as well&#x2014;leaving me in awe of th...</p></p><h2>Developmental Psychology: The Growth of Mind and Behavior</h2><p><p><strong>Clear, compelling, and authoritative.</strong></p> Frank Keil&#x2019;s <em>Developmental Psychology</em> represents his vision of how psychology should be taught and is based on nearly four decades of teaching a lecture course in developmental psychology and conducting developmental research.

Here, Evelyn Welch presents a fresh picture of the Italian Renaissance by challenging traditional scholarship and placing emphasis on recreating the experience of contemporary Italians: the patrons who commissioned the works, the members of the public who viewed them, and the artists who produced them. <em>Art and Society in Italy</em> <em>1350-1500</em> dramatically revises the traditional story of the Renaissance and takes into account new issues that have greatly enriched our understanding of the period. From paintings and coins to sculptures and tapestries, Welch examines the issues of materials, workshop practices, and artist-patron relationships, and explores the ways in which visual imagery related to contemporary sexual, social, and political behavior.</p><p><br><em>About the Author</em>:<br> <strong>Evelyn Welch</strong> is Lecturer, School of European Studies, University of Sussex. Her publications include <em>Art and Authority in Renaissance Milan</em>.<br>Turner's (arts and humanities, New York Univ.) introduction to early Renaissance Florence neatly articulates the economic, political, and religious milieu of the city's artistic efflorescence. Within that context, he artfully limns an image of the expanding urban fabric of the 14th and 15th centuries. Besides evoking the problems of artistic function, patronage, and the training and professional life of the artist, the author articulates the intricate stylistic byways that mark the onset of the new Renaissance approach in sculpture, architecture, and painting, including a survey of the interior decoration of monasteries and homes and a contextual overview of some of the key monuments of the later 15th century. While unsurprising in its approach and conclusions, this carefully etched work is more than adequate as a primer to the study of the early Renaissance in Florence. Welch (Art and Authority in Renaissance Milan, Yale Univ., 1995) casts his investigative net over all Italy. Giving particular emphasis to the social ambiance in which art is produced and consumed, his discussion is marked by its scholarly breadth, clarity of argument, and willingness to include objects not within the canonic corpus. Readers should derive a deeper appreciation of the way contemporaries may have experienced works of art and the historical, religious, and intellectual environment from which they emerged. Along with keen analyses of the materials and the making of objects, workshop practices, and the relationship of artists and patrons, the context and function of sacred, public, and domestic works are vividly delineated here. While largely eschewing the formal analysis of traditional art history, Welch's deeply informed and wide-ranging synthesis is a significant and welcome addition to the literature.?Robert Cahn, Fashion Inst. of Technology, New York<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>John Tyler, the Accidental President</h2><p>The first vice president to become president on the death of the incumbent, John Tyler (1790-1862) was derided by critics as "His Accidency."

The Briefing critiques the prevailing managerial and mechanistic paradigm in education, and argues that an ecological view of educational theory, practice and policy is necessary to assist the sustainability transition. The Briefing then shows how sustainable education is a systemic change of educational culture towards the realization of human potential and the interdependence of social, economic and ecological wellbeing.</p><p>Stephen Sterling is an independent consultant working in the academic and NGO fields in the UK and internationally.

After marrying in 1970, they moved to California, where Terry earned her doctorate in marine ecology at the University of Southern California and Gerry earned his doctorate in neurobiology at the California Institute of Technology. As postdoctoral students at the University of Washington&#39;s marine laboratories, they worked together on the neural bases of behavior, using a marine mollusk as a model system. Terry and Gerry are now professors of biology at the University of Colorado at Denver, where they have taught introductory biology and neurobiology since 1982. In their research lab, funded by the National Institutes of Health, they investigate the mechanisms by which neurons are harmed by low levels of environmental pollutants. Terry and Gerry share a deep appreciation of nature and of the outdoors. They enjoy hiking in the Rockies, running near their home in the foothills west of Denver, and attempting to garden at 7000 feet in the presence of hungry deer and elk. They are long-time members of many conservation organizations. Their daughter, Heather, has added another focus to their lives. &#34;Bruce E. Byers,&#34; a midwesterner transplanted to the hills of western Massachusetts, is a professor in the biology department at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. He&#39;s been a member of the faculty at UMass (where he also completed his doctoral degree) since 1993. Bruce teaches introductory biology courses for both nonmajors and majors; he also teaches courses in ornithology and animal behavior. A lifelong fascination with birds ultimately led Bruce to scientific exploration of avian biology. His currentresearch focuses on the behavioral ecology of birds, especially on the function and evolution of the vocal signals that birds use to communicate. The pursuit of vocalizations often takes Bruce outdoors, where he can be found before dawn, tape recorder in hand, awaiting the first songs of a new day.</p><h2>Native Nations: First North Americans as Seen by Edward Curtis</h2><p>A collection of 125 photographs from turn-of-the-century photographer Edward Curtis chronicles the passing glory of the native American nations.</p><p>This stunning collection selects 110 striking photographs taken by Curtis (1868-1952) in his nearly 30-year effort, begun at the turn of the century, to create what Cardozo, a Curtis specialist and photograph dealer, calls "an irreplaceable photographic and ethnographic record" of Native Americans. The photographs, reproduced using a new printing technology, are arresting. Portraits like those of Chief Joseph of the Nez Perce and of a Mohave woman potter show the dignity and endurance of these Americans. Landscape pictures of tepees in winter or a canoe-with-hunter suggest the shadings of a charcoal master and demonstrate Curtis's artistry. The photographs also range over pottery, masked dancers and various ritual objects and are accompanied by Curtis's detailed, stately captions. Some Native Americans have criticized Curtis for stereotypical, stylized images, notes former museum curator Horse Capture, but to him, they are images of beauty, power and pride. Indeed, the portrait of Horse Capture's great-grandfather is another moving epitaph for a lost world. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.Practically everyone who has seen a film or illustrated book on the history of North American Indians has seen some of the photographs of Edward S. Curtis (1868-1952), an ethnographer when the word was young and obscure. He undertook to document all the North American tribes when he was young and ignorant enough to think it would be a relatively manageable task, 5 or 6 years long and costing $25,000. It took 30 years and $1.5 million instead, expanding in the process to include the making of 10,000 wax cylinder recordings of Indian language and music. The photographs and accompanying descriptive text were eventually published in 20 volumes, from which 110 plates and excerpts have been culled for this handsome oversize book. The cachet of this particular outing for these pictures is that they are reproduced via a new method that allows greater tonal fidelity and resolution than halftone dot generation; these pictures look more like direct prints from negatives.

Offering almost 300 tantalizing recipes ranging from the most pristine consomm�s to the heartiest peasant stews, the book also provides extensive technical information, tips, and serving suggestions that make it a true soup tutorial. The book's "ultimate goal," says Peterson, "is to give the reader the tools with which to invent," an aim he realizes with clarity, warmth, and precision. It's hard to imagine a cook who wouldn't embrace this authoritative yet companionable work.<p> The recipe range is vast.

Among the entries new to this edition are Roast Garlic and Acorn Squash Soup, Thai-Style Hot and Sour Blue Crab Soup, and Dried Fruit Soup, a traditional Swedish specialty. Especially noteworthy is Peterson's introductory section on ethnic soups; a section offering strategies for reducing a soup's fat content (don't let meat broths boil, which homogenizes fat and liquid); and advice on what to drink with soup.

She traces the impact of Manet&#x2019;s reconsideration of the black model into the twentieth century and across the Atlantic, where Henri Matisse visited Harlem jazz clubs and later produced transformative portraits of black dancers as icons of modern beauty. These and other works by the artist are set in dialogue with the urbane &#x201c;New Negro&#x201d; portraiture style with which Harlem Renaissance artists including Charles Alston and Laura Wheeler Waring defied racial stereotypes. The book concludes with a look at how Manet&#x2019;s and Matisse&#x2019;s depictions influenced Romare Bearden and continue to reverberate in the work of such global contemporary artists as Faith Ringgold, Aim� Mpane, Maud Sulter, and Mickalene Thomas, who draw on art history to explore its multiple voices.<br> &nbsp;<br> Featuring over 175 illustrations and profiles of several models, <i>Posing Modernity</i> illuminates long-obscured figures and proposes that a history of modernism cannot be complete until it examines the vital role of the black female muse within it.</p><p>This engaging book offers a revelatory study of the role that the black female model has played in the development and evolution of modern art from Edouard Manet to Mickalene Thomas.&nbsp;<p><b>Denise Murrell </b>is curator, <i>Posing Modernity</i> exhibition, and Ford Foundation Postdoctoral Research Scholar at the Miriam and Ira D.

This Penguin Modern Classics edition includes an introduction by Declan Kiberd.</b> <p>For Joyce, literature 'is the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man'. Written between 1914 and 1921, Ulysses has survived bowdlerization, legal action and bitter controversy. Capturing a single day in the life of Dubliner Leopold Bloom, his friends Buck Mulligan and Stephen Dedalus, his wife Molly, and a scintillating cast of supporting characters, Joyce pushes Celtic lyricism and vulgarity to splendid extremes. An undisputed modernist classic, its ceaseless verbal inventiveness and astonishingly wide-ranging allusions confirm its standing as an imperishable monument to the human condition. Declan Kilberd says in his introduction that Ulysses is 'an endlessly open book of utopian epiphanies. It holds a mirror up to the colonial capital that was Dublin on 16 June 1904, but it also offers redemptive glimpses of a future world which might be made over in terms of those utopian moments.'</p> <p>This edition is the standard Random House/Bodley Head text that first appeared in 1960.</p> <p> <b>James Joyce</b> (1882&#x2013;1941), the eldest of ten children, was born in Dublin, but exiled himself to Paris at twenty as a rebellion against his upbringing. He only returned to Ireland briefly from the continent but Dublin was at heart of his greatest works, Ulysses and Finnegans Wake. He lived in poverty until the last ten years of his life and was plagued by near blindness and the grief of his daughter's mental illness.</p> <p>If you enjoyed Ulysses, you might enjoy Virginia Woolf's Mrs Dalloway, also available in Penguin Classics.</p> <p>'Everybody knows now that Ulysses is the greatest novel of the twentieth century'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Burgess, Observer</p></p><p><i>Ulysses</i> has been labeled dirty, blasphemous, and unreadable. In a famous 1933 court decision, Judge John M. Woolsey declared it an emetic book--although he found it sufficiently unobscene to allow its importation into the United States--and Virginia Woolf was moved to decry James Joyce's "cloacal obsession." None of these adjectives, however, do the slightest justice to the novel. To this day it remains <i>the</i> modernist masterpiece, in which the author takes both Celtic lyricism and vulgarity to splendid extremes. It is funny, sorrowful, and even (in a close-focus sort of way) suspenseful. And despite the exegetical industry that has sprung up in the last 75 years, <i>Ulysses</i> is also a compulsively readable book. Even the verbal vaudeville of the final chapters can be navigated with relative ease, as long as you're willing to be buffeted, tickled, challenged, and (occasionally) vexed by Joyce's sheer command of the English language.<p> Among other things, a novel is simply a long story, and the first question about any story is: <i>What happens?</i>. In the case of <i>Ulysses</i>, the answer might be <i>Everything</i>. William Blake, one of literature's sublime myopics, saw the universe in a grain of sand. Joyce saw it in Dublin, Ireland, on June 16, 1904, a day distinguished by its utter normality. Two characters, Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom, go about their separate business, crossing paths with a gallery of indelible Dubliners. We watch them teach, eat, stroll the streets, argue, and (in Bloom's case) masturbate. And thanks to the book's stream-of-consciousness technique--which suggests no mere stream but an impossibly deep, swift-running river--we're privy to their thoughts, emotions, and memories. The result? Almost every variety of human experience is crammed into the accordian folds of a single day, which makes <i>Ulysses</i> not just an experimental work but the very last word in realism. </p><p> Both characters add their glorious intonations to the music of Joyce's prose. Dedalus's accent--that of a freelance aesthetician, who dabbles here and there in what we might call Early Yeats Lite--will be familiar to readers of <i>Portrait of an Artist As a Young Man</i>. But Bloom's wistful sensualism (and naive curiosity) is something else entirely. Seen through his eyes, a rundown corner of a Dublin graveyard is a figure for hope and hopelessness, mortality and dogged survival: "Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels, crosses, broken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast eyes, old Ireland's hearts and hands. More sensible to spend the money on some charity for the living. Pray for the repose of the soul of. Does anybody really?" --<i>James Marcus</i></p>The 1934 text, as corrected and reset in 1961. Ulysses is one of the most influential novels of the twentieth century. It was not easy to find a publisher in America willing to take it on, and when Jane Jeap and Margaret Anderson started printing extracts from the book their literary magazine The Little Review in 1918, they were arrested and charged with publishing obscenity. They were fined $100, and even The New York Times expressed satisfaction with their conviction. Ulysses was not published in book form until 1922, when another American woman, Sylvia Beach, published it in Paris for her Shakespeare &amp; Company. Ulysses was not available legally in any English-speaking country until 1934, when Random House successfully defended Joyce against obscenity charges and published it in the Modern Library. This edition follows the complete and unabridged text as corrected and reset in 1961. Judge John Woolsey's decision lifting the ban against Ulysses is reprinted, along with a letter from Joyce to Bennett Cerf, the publisher of Random House, and the original foreword to the book by Morris L. Ernst, who defended Ulysses during the trial.</p><h2>Human Resource Development</h2><p>Master the basics of human resource development with HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT!

Born out of wedlock to a dark-skinned maid and Lorenzo de' Medici, he was the last legitimate heir to the line of Lorenzo the Magnificent. When Alessandro's noble father died of syphilis, the family looked to him. Groomed for power, he carved a path through the backstabbing world of Italian politics in a time when cardinals, popes, and princes vied for wealth and advantage. By the age of nineteen, he was prince of Florence, inheritor of the legacy of the grandest dynasty of the Italian Renaissance.<br><br>Alessandro faced down family rivalry and enormous resistance from Florence's oligarchs, who called him a womanizer-which he undoubtedly was--and a tyrant. Yet this real-life counterpart to Machiavelli's Prince kept his grip on power until he was assassinated at the age of 26 during a late-night tryst arranged by his scheming cousins. After his death, his brief but colorful reign was criticized by those who had murdered him in a failed attempt to restore the Florentine republic. For the first time, the true story is told in <em>The Black Prince of Florence</em>.<br><br>Catherine Fletcher tells the riveting tale of Alessandro's unexpected rise and spectacular fall, unraveling centuries-old mysteries, exposing forgeries, and bringing to life the epic personalities of the Medicis, Borgias, and others as they waged sordid campaigns to rise to the top. Drawing on new research and first-hand sources, this biography of a most intriguing Renaissance figure combines archival scholarship with discussions of race and class that are still relevant today.<br></p><p><br><strong>Catherine Fletcher</strong> is a historian of Renaissance and early modern Europe.

Here she has used the same skills to even greater effect, creating a compelling portrait of a forgotten man--himself both brutal and brutalised--once at the very heart of the Renaissance world order.

But in his mind, he envisions himself traveling at a speed beyond imagining, on a beam of light. This brilliant mind will one day offer up some of the most revolutionary ideas ever conceived. From a boy endlessly fascinated by the wonders around him, Albert Einstein ultimately grows into a man of genius recognized the world over for profoundly illuminating our understanding of the universe. Jennifer Berne and Vladimir Radunsky invite the reader to travel along with Einstein on a journey full of curiosity, laughter, and scientific discovery. Parents and children alike will appreciate this moving story of the powerful difference imagination can make in any life.</p><p>Jennifer Berne is the author of the acclaimed Manfish, about Jacques Cousteau, and spends her time writing children's books about the subjects she loves most&#x2014;our amazing universe and the people who are passionate about it. She lives in Copake, New York.<br><br>Vladimir Radunsky, when not creating award-winning children's books, refills his soul with the sounds of Bach, Chopin, and Snoop Dogg. He lives in Rome, Italy.*Starred Review* It&#x2019;s not easy to explain the work of Albert Einstein to a young audience, but this marvelous book pulls it off. It does so by providing an overview of Einstein&#x2019;s life: the way he thought and how his remarkable ideas changed the way scientists think. Berne begins with baby Albert, who didn&#x2019;t say a word. And as he got older, he didn&#x2019;t say a word&#x2014;but he looked and wondered. When he was a student, his teachers thought he was too different, but his differences led him to think about natural phenomenon like light and numbers in new ways. The book reroutes the text around events in Einstein&#x2019;s life, such as his escape from Nazi Germany and his move to the U.S., and it only touches upon his work on the nuclear bomb. This is a more personal look, but still, it explains how he came to the discovery of atoms and his theories about the speed of light. The text could not have better support than Radunsky&#x2019;s artwork. Executed on textured papers, the stylized watercolors outlined in ink sometimes eschew decoration, with the focus on Einstein and others in his life; other spreads are swirled with words and numbers. The book stresses that readers may someday answer the questions that Einstein didn&#x2019;t get to, and an author&#x2019;s note extends the text with paragraphs about Einstein&#x2019;s pacifism, personality, and thought experiments.

He approaches Lacan through the motifs and works of contemporary popular culture, from Hitchcock's <i>Vertigo</i> to Stephen King's <i>Pet Sematary</i>, from McCullough's <i>An Indecent Obsession</i> to Romero's <i>Return of the Living Dead</i>&#x2015;a strategy of "looking awry" that recalls the exhilarating and vital experience of Lacan.</p><p>&#x17d;i&#x17e;ek discovers fundamental Lacanian categories the triad Imaginary/Symbolic/Real, the object small a, the opposition of drive and desire, the split subject&#x2015;at work in horror fiction, in detective thrillers, in romances, in the mass media's perception of ecological crisis, and, above all, in Alfred Hitchcock's films.

Disconcertingly vulnerable, Portia is manifestly trying to understand what is going on around her and looking for something that is not there. Evident victim, she is also an inadvertent victimiser - her impossible lovingness and austere trust being too much for her admirer Eddie, who is himself defensive and uncomfortable in this society which has managed to bring them together. In the midst of the rising tension is set perhaps Elizabeth Bowen&#39;s most brilliant piece of social comedy, when, at a seaside villa full of rollicking young people, Portia experiences at least temporary relief from the misery Eddie seems determined to bring her.</p><p>Five words of advice on reading Elizabeth Bowen: Resist the urge to skim. In <i>The Death of the Heart</i>, Bowen's writing rolls ever onward, accruing the sensations and ironies of conscious living till the final effect is massive. This is not prose for people who like their fiction with a cool, Calvin Klein-like minimalism. Bowen's people are keenly aware, and she seems to catalogue every sweaty moment, every betraying glance. The reader must stay right there with her, because hidden among lengthy descriptions of sea air and drawing-room politics are pithy asides worthy of great humorists: "Absence blots people out. We really have no absent friends." Skimmers miss out.<p> <i>The Death of the Heart</i> is Bowen's most perfectly made book. Portia, an orphan, comes to live in London with her half-brother, Thomas, and his wife, Anna. A child of sin raised in a series of shabby French hotels, Portia is possessed of a kind of terrible innocence. Like Chance the Gardener in pigtails, she literally can't comprehend evil or unkind motives. Unfortunately for her, she falls in with Anna's friend Eddie, who seems to be made entirely of bad motives. Though the plot follows Portia's relationship with Eddie, the novel's real tension lies between Portia and Anna, as the girl comes to grief against the shoals of Anna's glittering, urbane cynicism. But the book transcends the theme of innocence corrupted. As in Graham Greene's <i>The Quiet American</i>, Bowen inverts the formula to show the destructive power of innocence itself: </p><blockquote>Innocence so constantly finds itself in a false position that inwardly innocent people learn to be disingenuous.... Incurable strangers to the world, they never cease to exact a heroic happiness. Their singleness, their ruthlessness, their one continuous wish makes them bound to be cruel, and to suffer cruelty. The innocent are so few that two of them seldom meet--and when they do, their victims lie strewn all around.</blockquote> Bowen has a fine eye for such shadings of morality, but finer still is her understanding of the way humans bump up against the material world. Her writing on weather, both emotional and meteorological, compares with the best of Henry James: "One's first day by the sea, one's being feels salt, strong, resilient, and hollow--like a seaweed pod not giving under the heel."<p> Always a sensitive observer of the way we live, in her lesser books Bowen deals in mind games and then delivers trumped-up, bloody endings. In <i>The Death of the Heart</i>, she keeps all the action between her characters' ears, and comes up with one of the great midcentury psychological novels. <i>--Claire Dederer</i></p>Elizabeth Bowen is widely considered to be one of the greatest novelists of this century. While her novels masquerade as witty comedies of manners, set in the lavish country houses of the Anglo-Irish or in elegant London homes, they mine the depths of private tragedy with a subtle ferocity and psychological complexity reminiscent of Henry James.<p>The Death of the Heart, a story of adolescent love and the betrayal of innocence, is perhaps Bowen's best-known book. When sixteen-year-old Portia, recently orphaned, arrives in London and falls for an attractive cad -- a seemingly carefree young man who is as much an outsider in the sophisticated and politely treacherous world of 1930s drawing rooms as she is -- their collision threatens to shatter the carefully built illusions of everyone around them. As she deftly and delicately exposes the cruelty that lurks behind the polished surfaces of conventional society, Bowen reveals herself as a masterful novelist who combines a sharp sense of humor with a devastating gift for divining human motivations.</p></p><h2>World Religions: Western Traditions</h2><p>Featuring work from expert contributors, <em>World Religions: Western Traditions,</em> Fourth Edition, provides students with an authoritative examination of Jewish, Christian, Muslim, ancient, indigenous, and new traditions.

She has decided not to get married and instead spends her time organizing her acquaintances' love affairs. Her plans for the matrimonial success of her new friend Harriet, however, lead her into complications that ultimately test her own detachment from the world of romance.</p></p><p>Of all Jane Austen's heroines, Emma Woodhouse is the most flawed, the most infuriating, and, in the end, the most endearing. <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>'s Lizzie Bennet has more wit and sparkle; Catherine Morland in <i> Northanger Abbey</i> more imagination; and <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>'s Elinor Dashwood certainly more sense--but Emma is lovable precisely because she is so imperfect. Austen only completed six novels in her lifetime, of which five feature young women whose chances for making a good marriage depend greatly on financial issues, and whose prospects if they fail are rather grim. <i>Emma</i> is the exception: "Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her." One may be tempted to wonder what Austen could possibly find to say about so fortunate a character. The answer is, quite a lot. <p> For Emma, raised to think well of herself, has <i>such</i> a high opinion of her own worth that it blinds her to the opinions of others. The story revolves around a comedy of errors: Emma befriends Harriet Smith, a young woman of unknown parentage, and attempts to remake her in her own image. Ignoring the gaping difference in their respective fortunes and stations in life, Emma convinces herself and her friend that Harriet should look as high as Emma herself might for a husband--and she zeroes in on an ambitious vicar as the perfect match. At the same time, she reads too much into a flirtation with Frank Churchill, the newly arrived son of family friends, <i>and</i> thoughtlessly starts a rumor about poor but beautiful Jane Fairfax, the beloved niece of two genteelly impoverished elderly ladies in the village. As Emma's fantastically misguided schemes threaten to surge out of control, the voice of reason is provided by Mr. Knightly, the Woodhouse's longtime friend and neighbor. Though Austen herself described Emma as "a heroine whom no one but myself will much like," she endowed her creation with enough charm to see her through her most egregious behavior, and the saving grace of being able to learn from her mistakes. By the end of the novel Harriet, Frank, and Jane are all properly accounted for, Emma is wiser (though certainly not sadder), and the reader has had the satisfaction of enjoying Jane Austen at the height of her powers. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Emma is Austen&#39;s most technically accomplished novel, with a hidden plot, the full implications of which are only revealed by a second reading. The text presented here retains the spelling and punctuation of the first edition of 1816, allowing readers to see the novel as Austen&#39;s contemporaries first encountered it. The volume provides comprehensive explanatory notes, an extensive critical introduction, a chronology of Austen&#39;s life, and an authoritative textual apparatus.

They give a crucial new impetus to the story of the Grail by establishing a provenance for the sacred vessel - and for the Round Table itself - in the Biblical past; and through the controlling figure of Merlin they link the story of Joseph of Arimathea with the mythical British history of Vortigern and Utherpendragon, the birth of Arthur, and the sword in the stone, and then with the knightly adventures of Perceval&#39;s Grail quest and the betrayal and death of Arthur, creating the very first Arthurian cycle. Ambitious, original and complete in its conception, this trilogy - translated here for the first time - is a finely paced, vigorous piece of storytelling that provides an outstanding example of the essentially oral nature of early prose.

Amore's <i>The Art of the Con </i>tells the stories of some of history's most notorious yet untold cons. They involve stolen art hidden for decades; elaborate ruses that involve the Nazis and allegedly plundered art; the theft of a conceptual prototype from a well-known artist by his assistant to be used later to create copies; the use of online and television auction sites to scam buyers out of millions; and other confidence scams incredible not only for their boldness but more so because they actually worked. Using interviews and newly released court documents, <i>The Art of the Con</i> will also take the reader into the investigations that led to the capture of the con men, who oftentimes return back to the world of crime.

UP.</p><p>Cozzens follows up his magisterial account of the Battle of Chickamauga, <i>This Terrible Sound</i> (1992), with an equally authoritative study of the Chattanooga campaign that followed it. Braxton Bragg (who sometimes seems unfit to have been at large on the public streets, let alone commanding armies) failed to either destroy or starve out the Union Army of the Cumberland. In due course, superior Northern resources and strategy--not tactics; few generals on either side come out looking like good tacticians--progressively loosened the Confederate cordon around the city. Finally, the Union drove off Bragg's army entirely in the famous Battle of Missionary Ridge, which was a much more complex affair than previous, heroic accounts make it. Like its predecessor on Chickamauga, this is such a good book on Chattanooga that it's hard to believe any Civil War collection will need another book on the subject for at least a generation. <i>Roland Green</i>&#34;Beyond question the most thoroughly researched and well-written account of the loss of Chattanooga to date.&#34;--William C.

Thus, it is an update of the Variorum Minor Poems, published in the 1940s, and a successful one. It surpasses the Everyman edition (now out of print) in not modernizing spellings and in glossing difficult or arcane terms. The print is attractive and the book a pleasure to read; the paperback version should find wide use in Renaissance literature courses. The price of the hardcover version, however, will present problems for many libraries. Still, libraries wanting an update of the Variorum , or lacking it while having an active Spenser audience, should consider this strongly.<br><i>- Robert E. Brown, Onondaga Cty.

His coming initiated the period of the second transmission of Buddhism to Tibet, formative for the Sakya Kagyu and Gelug traditions of Tibetan Buddhism. Atisha's most celebrated text, <i>Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment</i>,<i> </i>sets forth the entire Buddhist path within the framework of three levels of motivation on the part of the practitioner. Atisha's text thus became the source of the lamrim tradition, or graduated stages of the path to enlightenment, an approach to spiritual practice incorporated within all schools of Tibetan Buddhism.</p><p>Geshe Sonam Rinchen (1933&#x2013;2013) studied at Sera Je Monastery and in 1980 received the Lharampa Geshe degree.

Despite an occasionally perceptible British bias, the authors have tried hard to paint a colorful, vivid picture of the many faces and varieties of English. The text is never dull, but is enlivened by innumerable examples and by interviews with representative individuals: a minister in Scotland, a couple from the Appalachians, a storekeeper in Newfoundland, a Philadelphia shoeshine man, a cockney fruitseller, an Australian farm family, the president of Sierra Leone, a writing professor in India.

Three enormous red digits&#x2013;2:59&#x2013;assaulted my eyes.<br><br>&#x201c;Hello?&#x201d; The voice on the phone was deep and croaky. &#x201c;Detective Ollie<br>Chandler?&#x201d;<br><br>I nodded my head, admitting it.<br><br>&#x201c;Chandler?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t answer your cell.&#x201d; His voice was a hacksaw cutting a rain gutter.<br><br>&#x201c;You awake?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No. But...you may as well finish the job.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In bed?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mowin&#x2019; the lawn. Who died?&#x201d;<br><br>I&#x2019;ve been waiting all my life for good news from a 3:00 a.m. phone call. It&#x2019;s been a wait of Chicago Cubs proportions.<br> <br>Many imagine that middle-of-the-night phone calls mean someone&#x2019;s been killed. I don&#x2019;t imagine it. It&#x2019;s true.<br><br>Jake Woods tells me there&#x2019;s a God in charge of the universe. I&#x2019;m not convinced. But if there is, I&#x2019;d appreciate it if He&#x2019;d schedule murders during day shift.<br><br>&#x201c;Victim&#x2019;s Jimmy Ross,&#x201d; Sergeant Jim Seymour said. I pictured him sitting home in his underwear. Not a pretty picture.<br><br>&#x201c;Drug dealer.&#x201d;<br><br>I didn&#x2019;t shed a tear. They say cops are cynical. To me drug dealers are a waste of protoplasm. They should be shot, injected, then put on the electric chair at a low setting.<br><br>&#x201c;Officer Sayson&#x2019;s the patrol,&#x201d; Sergeant Seymour said. &#x201c;1760 Southeast Clinton, apartment 34.&#x201d; I scratched it down in the dark, postponing those first daggers of light.<br><br>As I hung up, I sensed a presence in the dark room and reached toward the nightstand for my Smith and Wesson 340 revolver. I saw the whites of two eyes three feet away. My hand clenched the revolver. Suddenly I recognized the sympathetic eyes of Mike Hammer, my bullmastiff, who spends his nights getting in and out of my bed, licking my toes to reassure me he&#x2019;s back.<br><br>Slowly I withdrew my hand from the gun, not wanting to send the wrong message to my bullie.<br><br>What was wrong with me? How could I forget Mike Hammer, my roommate and best friend? I shuddered, remembering five years ago, when I drew the gun on Sharon when she came back to bed after taking Advil.<br><br>The problem with morning is that it comes before my first cup of coffee. I stumbled toward the kitchen, fingertips on the hallway wall, stubbing my toe on the exercise bike Sharon bought me. I&#x2019;ve used it twice in four years. I keep it around to maintain the illusion that it&#x2019;s making me healthy. Since this helps me justify the next cheeseburger, it&#x2019;s worth every penny she paid.<br><br>I keep water in my top-of-the-line Mr. Coffee, poured to the ten-cup mark, with Starbucks French roast always waiting. In my quest for maximum darkness, I load the filter to the top. Whether it&#x2019;s 7:00 a.m. or 3:00 a.m., I can throw the switch and, even though the world&#x2019;s going to hell in a handbasket, coffee&#x2019;s brewing...so there&#x2019;s hope.<br><br>I leaned against the fridge and pulled the pot off the burner every few ounces to get what was there. I&#x2019;d mainline it if I could. Sharon told me maybe I should drink less coffee now that Juan Valdez named his donkey after me.<br><br>Trying to remember whether I&#x2019;d had three hours of sleep or two, I put Mike Hammer&#x2013;I call him Mulch for short&#x2013;out the back door to do his business. Every morning he acts like it&#x2019;s his first time, a privilege he&#x2019;s been waiting for all his life. After two minutes outside for him and six more ounces of coffee for me, Mulch blew open the door to get his biscuit.<br><br>I abandoned Mr. Coffee and headed for the bathroom. I put my face two inches from the showerhead and let the water pummel me.<br><br>Presumably I dressed, poured the last of the coffee into my thirty-ounce mug, and said good-bye to two of my favorite people&#x2013;Mulch and Mr. Coffee. Mulch licked my face. I wiped off Mulch-slobber and tossed the paper towel at the sink, coming up short. I slowly shut the front door, watching Mulch shred the paper towel&#x2013;his reward whenever I miss.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re in charge while I&#x2019;m gone.&#x201d;<br><br>Mulch loves it when I say that.<br><br>It was early November but felt like late December. Like a polar bear on ice, I negotiated the slick walk to my white Ford Taurus. I dropped into the driver&#x2019;s seat and kicked aside a Big Gulp cup and a Burger King bag, which expelled the scent of French fries like a perfume spray bottle. I must have been on a stakeout the night before. Maybe two nights before. Eventually I&#x2019;d remember.<br><br>You shouldn&#x2019;t assume I was conscious during all this. A detective establishes his routine so he can do it in his sleep. You wake up on the way, more at each stoplight. By the time you really need consciousness, it&#x2019;s usually there. You just hope it doesn&#x2019;t arrive at the scene after you do.<br><br>It was dripping cold. I drew the window half down to double-team with the coffee. Every few blocks I stuck my face out&#x2013;I learned this from Mulch&#x2013;and gulped a quick fix of wet oxygen. Then I pulled in my frozen face and warmed it with the coffee. It&#x2019;s a ritual, like those Scandahoovean men who go back and forth from ice baths to saunas.<br><br>The Portland night, nearly uninhabited, smelled of frosty rain on asphalt. It reminded me of working the beat, night shift. One year I saw no daylight between November and February. From what I heard, I didn&#x2019;t miss much.<br><br>When you&#x2019;re on the &#x201c;up team&#x201d;&#x2013;on call for the next murder&#x2013;getting yanked from the netherworld in the middle of the night comes with the territory. It&#x2019;s the only thing easier now since Sharon died: I don&#x2019;t have to worry about her worrying about me.<br><br>I turned onto Burnside, next to Max, the light-rail tracks, where there&#x2019;s only one lane. Occasionally people don&#x2019;t understand that what I&#x2019;m doing is more important than what they&#x2019;re doing. The moron in front of me&#x2013;only the fourth car I&#x2019;d seen&#x2013;just sat there in his lowrider Acura Integra, figuring that since it&#x2019;s 3:23 a.m., he can chat with someone on the curb, even after the light&#x2019;s turned green.<br><br>My Taurus is a slicktop&#x2013;unmarked. Cop on the inside, civilian on the outside. Usually that&#x2019;s handy. Not this time. I honked. Nothing.<br><br>I honked again. Then I reached to my right and typed in the license number on my mobile data computer. I honked a third time.<br><br>The bozo charged out of his car, yelling and swearing. When he was two feet from my window, I pulled my Glock 19 and pointed it at his face.<br><br>&#x201c;Get out of my way. <i>Now</i>.&#x201d;<br><br>He froze, with the fixated expression of a man wetting his pants. He scuttled back to his car sideways, like a crab, and hopped in, banging his head on the door frame. He turned his key with a garbage-disposal grind, forgetting he&#x2019;d left the car running. He screeched through the now-red light.<br><br>I flipped on my flashing red and blue grill-mounted strobes. He edged to the right, and I passed with an inch clearance. My computer screen flashed. I lowered my passenger window and shouted, &#x201c;Have a nice day, Nathan Roberts!&#x201d;<br><br>Okay, maybe when he approached my car I should have identified myself as a cop. But many people assume that if you&#x2019;re a cop you won&#x2019;t shoot them. I didn&#x2019;t want Nathan to labor under this assumption.<br><br>Having been a cop for thirty years, I find that you can get most of what you want with a kind word. But sometimes, as Al Capone put it, you can get more of what you want with a kind word and a gun.<br><br>&#x201c;Sayson?&#x201d; I spoke into the car phone. &#x201c;Chandler. Homicide. On my way. 1760 Southeast Clinton? Apartments?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Greenbridge Arms. Third floor, four doors left off the elevator. Apartment 34&#x2019;s sealed. My partner&#x2019;s checking on neighbors. Dozen people heard the shots. One possible witness.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Be there in five.&#x201d;<br><br>When I&#x2019;m on the up team, anybody who kills somebody does it on my watch. That means they&#x2019;re messin&#x2019; with me. And messin&#x2019; with me&#x2019;s like wearin&#x2019; cheese underwear down rat alley.<br><br>I pulled up to the Greenbridge Arms, studying the four-story brick building. I settled next to one of three patrol cars in a no parking zone, beside a van labeled KAGN.<br><br>Four criminals rushed me, armed with notepads, pens, electronic gadgets, and cameras. Crips and Bloods have a name. So do these&#x2013;journalists.<br><br>&#x201c;What can you tell us, Detective Chandler?&#x201d; The <i>Oregon Tribune </i>reporter brandished her notepad, poison pen ready to scribble.<br><br>&#x201c;Nothing. If you check your notes, you&#x2019;ll see I just arrived.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re denying us entrance to the apartments.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good for them.&#x201d; This was standard procedure, but reporters&#x2013;thinking they&#x2019;re royalty&#x2013;are outraged when they aren&#x2019;t allowed to trample a crime scene.<br><br>&#x201c;Victim&#x2019;s name&#x2019;s Jimmy Ross, apartment 34. Right?&#x201d;<br><br>Apparently someone on police radio had slipped up and said the victim&#x2019;s name. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a victim?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We called neighbors, and they confirmed it was Jimmy Ross. True?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why would I tell you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the harm? We heard it on the radio. We just want you to confirm it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t hold your breath.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re just doing our job.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re getting in the way of me doing <i>my </i>job. Monitor your own calls.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Cops don&#x2019;t own the airwaves. The public deserves to know what&#x2019;s going on.&#x201d;<br><br>I turned away as her photographer took a photo. He grabbed the sleeve of my trench coat. I yanked it back. I turned toward him. His camera flash did that dagger thing in my eyes.<br><br>&#x201c;Out of my face!&#x201d;<br><br>I saw the red light of a television news camera right behind him. Images of my anger management class assaulted me. I&#x2019;d sworn I&#x2019;d never subject myself to that again.<br><br>I smiled and waved to the camera. &#x201c;Just kidding! Actually, I want to thank you folks for coming. I wish I had time for tea and crumpets, but we have a crime to solve and people&#x2019;s lives to protect, so if it doesn&#x2019;t inconvenience you, I&#x2019;ll be going up to the crime scene now. Enjoy.&#x201d;<br><br>The <i>Tribune </i>and TV reporters and their cameramen followed me to the front door of the apartments, where Officer Brandon Gentry opened the door for me. He and I nodded at each other, two professionals trying to beat off the vultures. I wondered if he was an anger management alumnus. They should give us a secret hand signal. I signed his log sheet and wrote down the time: 3:39 a.m.<br><br>The TV cameraman pushed open the front door and did a quick sweep with his video. As I stepped in the elevator, I said, &#x201c;Officer Gentry, there&#x2019;s a van illegally parked. I think it has the letters KAGN on it. Would you please write a parking citation?&#x201d;<br><br>The door closed and I tried not to ponder how the media, especially the <i>Tribune</i>, had been my judge, jury, and nearly my executioner fifteen years before. I needed to switch gears to the job at hand. At least I was awake.<br><br>The elevator was old, with a bad case of asthma. As I got out on the third floor, I popped in a stick of Black Jack gum&#x2013;my crime scene entrance ritual.<br><br>I headed up the hall to the left and saw a cop, midtwenties, poised like a jackal guarding pharaoh&#x2019;s tomb.<br><br>&#x201c;Sayson?&#x201d;<br><br>He nodded, too eagerly. Academy written all over him, Officer Sayson exuded a Secret Service alertness. If he lives long enough, eventually it&#x2019;ll give way to the fear of dying on duty and leaving behind kids and the wife he&#x2019;s promised not to forsake. Eagerness to jump into the middle of a dangerous situation is inversely proportionate to age. Twenty years ago I was chasing armed fugitives down back alleys, by myself. Now my first thought is to call for SWAT teams, armored cars, helicopters, guided missiles, or stealth bombers&#x2013;whatever&#x2019;s available.<br><br>I&#x2019;m a Vietnam vet. Someone watching my back means everything. Officer Sayson was protecting my crime scene; he was my new best friend.<br><br>Entering apartment 34, I stepped from hallway to crime scene. There, sprawled in a death pose, was Jimmy Ross, two shots to the head. Physical evidence all over the place, with a bonus: a sealed Ziploc bag of Ecstasy and a half-spilled sack of meth. No need for a lab report to tell me what was what.<br><br>Sayson introduced me to the apartment manager, who assured me Ross lived alone. No wife, live-in girlfriend, brother, cousin, friend, or roommate. Sayson consulted two neighbors who&#x2019;d noticed lots of coming and going. The manager appeared shocked, as if he&#x2019;d never suspected one of his renters was a drug dealer. Go figure.<br><br>Since most murders are done by family members, that&#x2019;s where you look first. Domestic arguments normally begin in the living room, where weapons are limited. They migrate to the kitchen, where weapons abound, or the bedroom, where there&#x2019;s a gun, which has a way of ending fights. This argument had stayed in the living room. No sign the killer had been anywhere else&#x2013;only between the door and body. Didn&#x2019;t fit the domestic murder profile.<br><br>Sayson told me the paramedic who&#x2019;d come twenty minutes ago had pronounced Jimmy Ross dead. I looked at what used to be the man. He was dead all right.<br><br>The medical examiner, Carlton Hatch&#x2013;I&#x2019;d seen him at a dozen other homicides&#x2013;showed up ten minutes after I did. Most MEs ask you to call them when you want the body removed, after the crime scene&#x2019;s clean and detailed. Unless time of death is unknown, the ME may not arrive until three or four hours later. Not Hatch. Every time I&#x2019;ve worked with him, he&#x2019;s come immediately, like an autograph hound to an NFL team hotel.<br><br>Hatch is a number two pencil, head pink and bald like an eraser. He carries a man-purse and wears a nicely fitted suit beneath a poorly fitted face. His pointy chin isn&#x2019;t a good match for his pale, bloated cheeks. Too much chlorine in his gene pool.<br><br>I gazed down at my Wal-Mart jacket over my flannel shirt spotted with yesterday&#x2019;s bacon and cheese omelet. I considered my rumpled slacks, pockets holding Tuesday&#x2019;s Taco Bell receipt and a packet of hot sauce. Then I looked again at the ME&#x2019;s tailored suit.<br><br>&#x201c;Tuxedo at the dry cleaners?&#x201d; I asked him.<br><br>His smile came quick and left quicker. This guy should be home watching <i>Quincy </i>reruns. I wanted to be home sleeping it off or watching Jack Bauer interrogate a terrorist.<br><br>&#x201c;Blood spattered here.&#x201d; Hatch pointed to the wall. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t that interesting?&#x201d; I nodded, though it wasn&#x2019;t. I prefer the CSI techs, who quietly collect evidence, report to me, and let me interpret it. The ME&#x2019;s specialty is the state of the body: cause and time of death. I like it when people stick to their specialties.<br><br>&#x201c;Probable cause of death gunshots to the head,&#x201d; he said slowly, as if he had drawn on years of training to come up with this. Any kindergartner could have told me the same.<br><br>&#x201c;Another splatter here. Don&#x2019;t you find that interesting?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t that what you&#x2019;d expect with two head shots at close range?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Still, it&#x2019;s interesting.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;As interesting as last month&#x2019;s cricket scores,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>Two CSIs in forensic bunny suits arrived. One vacuumed; the other photographed. They collected blood samples, carpet fibers, and anything possibly containing DNA fragments. I sketched the scene on a yellow pad. I supplemented with dozens of photos on my Olympus digital camera. Nice change from the Polaroids we used to take.<br><br>&#x201c;Chandler?&#x201d; The loud voice startled everybody.

But when one of his stories from the Middle East is exposed as a fraud, his professional reputation crashes and burns. Now he lives in virtual exile&#x2014;haunted by bad decisions and a shocking truth he can never prove:&nbsp; that his downfall was a deliberate act of sabotage by an unknown enemy. But before Sagan can end his torment with the squeeze of a trigger, fate intervenes in the form of an enigmatic stranger.&nbsp; This stranger forces Sagan to act&#x2014;and his actions attract the attention of the Magellan Billet, a top-secret corps of the United States Justice Department that deals with America&#x2019;s most sensitive investigations. Sagan suddenly finds himself caught in an international incident, the repercussions of which will shudder not only Washington, D.C., but also Jerusalem. Coaxed into a deadly cat-and-mouse game, unsure who&#x2019;s friend and who&#x2019;s foe, Sagan is forced to Vienna, Prague, then finally into the Blue Mountains of Jamaica&#x2014;where his survival hinges on his rewriting everything we know about Christopher Columbus.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Don&#x2019;t miss Steve Berry&#x2019;s short story &#x201c;The Admiral&#x2019;s Mark&#x201d; and a sneak peek of his new novel, <i>The King&#x2019;s Deception, </i>in the back of the book.</b></p><p><b>Steve Berry</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> and #1 internationally bestselling author of <i>The Lincoln Myth, The King&#x2019;s Deception, The Columbus Affair, The Jefferson Key, The Emperor&#x2019;s Tomb, The Paris Vendetta, The Charlemagne Pursuit, The Venetian Betrayal, The Alexandria Link, The Templar Legacy, The Third Secret, The Romanov Prophecy, </i>and<i> The Amber Room</i>.

He&#x2019;d thought about this moment for the past year, debating the pros and cons, finally deciding that one pro outweighed all cons.<br><br>He simply did not want to live any longer.<br><br>He&#x2019;d once been an investigative reporter for the Los Angeles Times, knocking down a solid six-figure salary, his marquee byline generating one front-page, above-the-fold story after another. He&#x2019;d worked all over the world&#x2014;Sarajevo, Beijing, Johannesburg, Belgrade, and Moscow. But the Middle East became his specialty, a place he came to know intimately, where his reputation had been forged. His confidential files were once filled with hundreds of willing sources, people who knew he&#x2019;d protect them at all costs. He&#x2019;d proved that when he spent eleven days in a DC jail for failing to reveal his source on a story about a corrupt Pennsylvania congressman.<br><br>That man had gone to prison.<br><br>Tom had received his third Pulitzer nomination.<br><br>There were twenty-one awarded categories. One was for &#x201c;distinguished investigative reporting by an individual or team, reported as a single newspaper article or a series.&#x201d; Winners received a certificate, $10,000, and the ability to add three precious words&#x2014;Pulitzer Prize winner&#x2014;to their names.<br><br>He won his.<br><br>But they took it back.<br><br>Which seemed the story of his life.<br><br>Everything had been taken back.<br><br>His career, his reputation, his credibility, even his self-respect. In the end he became a failure as a son, a father, a husband, a reporter, and a friend. A few weeks ago he&#x2019;d charted that spiral on a pad, identifying that it all started when he was twenty-five, fresh out of the University of Florida, top third of his class, a journalism degree in hand.<br><br>Then his father disowned him.<br><br>Abiram Sagan had been unrelenting.<br><br>&#x201c;We all make choices. Good. Bad. Indifferent. You&#x2019;re a grown man, Tom, and have made yours. Now I have to make mine.&#x201d;<br><br>And that he had.<br><br>On that same pad he&#x2019;d jotted down the highs and lows. Some from before, as editor of his high school paper and campus reporter at college. Most after. His rise from news assistant, to staff reporter, to senior international correspondent. The awards. Accolades. Respect from his peers. How had one observer described his style? &#x201c;Wide-ranging and prescient reporting conducted at great personal risk.&#x201d;<br><br>Then his divorce.<br><br>The estrangement from his only child. Poor investment decisions. Even poorer life decisions.<br><br>Finally, his firing.<br><br>Eight years ago.<br><br>And the seemingly nothing life since.<br><br>Most of his friends were gone. But that was as much his fault as theirs. As his personal depression had deepened he&#x2019;d withdrawn into himself. Amazing he hadn&#x2019;t turned to alcohol or drugs, but neither had ever appealed to him.<br><br>Self-pity was his intoxicant.<br><br>He stared around at the house&#x2019;s interior.<br><br>He&#x2019;d decided to die, here, in his parents&#x2019; home. Fitting, in some morbid way. Thick layers of dust and a musty smell reminded him that for three years the rooms had sat empty. He&#x2019;d kept the utilities on, paid the meager taxes, and had the lawn cut just enough so the neighbors wouldn&#x2019;t complain. Earlier, he&#x2019;d noticed that the sprawling mulberry tree out front needed trimming, the picket fence painting.<br><br>He hated it here. Too many ghosts.<br><br>He walked the rooms, remembering happier days. In the kitchen he could still see the jars of his mother&#x2019;s jam that once lined the windowsill. The thought of her brought a wave of an unusual joy that quickly faded.<br><br>He should write a note and explain himself, blame somebody or something. But to who? Or what? Nobody would believe him if he told them the truth. Unfortunately, just like eight years ago, there was no one to blame but himself.<br><br>Would anyone even care he was gone?<br><br>Certainly not his daughter. He hadn&#x2019;t spoken to her in two years.<br><br>His literary agent? Maybe. She&#x2019;d made a lot of money off his ghostwriting. He&#x2019;d been shocked to learn how many so-called bestselling fiction writers could not write a word. What had one critic said at the time of his downfall? &#x201c;Journalist Sagan seems to have a promising career ahead of him writing fiction.&#x201d;<br><br>Asshole.<br><br>But he&#x2019;d actually taken that advice.<br><br>He wondered&#x2014;how do you explain taking your own life? It is, by definition, an irrational act. Which, by definition, defies explanation. Hopefully, somebody would bury him. He had plenty of money in the bank, more than enough for a respectable funeral.<br><br>What would it be like to be dead?<br><br>Were you aware? Could you hear? See? Smell? Or was it simply an eternal blackness. No thoughts. No feeling.<br><br>Nothing at all.<br><br>He walked back toward the front of the house.<br><br>Outside was a glorious March day, the noontime sun bright. Florida was truly blessed with some terrific weather. Like California, without the earthquakes, where he lived before his firing. He&#x2019;d miss the feel of a warm sun on a pleasant summer&#x2019;s day.<br><br>He stopped in the open archway and stared at the parlor. That was what his mother had always called the room. This was where his parents had gathered on Shabbat. Where Abiram read from the Torah. The place where Yom Kippur and Holy Days had been recognized. He recalled the sight of the pewter menorah on the far table burning. His parents had been devout Jews. After his bar mitzvah he, too, had first studied the Torah, standing before the twelve-paned windows, framed out by damask curtains his mother had taken months to sew. She&#x2019;d been talented with her hands, a lovely woman, universally adored. He missed her. She died six years before Abiram, who&#x2019;d now been gone three.<br><br>Time to end this.<br><br>He studied the gun, a pistol bought a few months before at an Orlando gun show, and sat on the sofa. Clouds of dust rose, then settled. He recalled Abiram&#x2019;s lecture about the birds and the bees as he&#x2019;d sat in the same spot. He&#x2019;d been, what, twelve?<br><br>Thirty-eight years ago.<br><br>But it seemed like last week.<br><br>As usual, the explanations had been rough and concise.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you understand?&#x201d; Abiram asked him. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s important that you do.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like girls.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You will. So don&#x2019;t forget what I said.&#x201d;<br><br>Women. Another failure. He&#x2019;d had precious few relationships as a young man, marrying Michele, the first girl who&#x2019;d shown serious interest in him. But the marriage ended after his firing, and there&#x2019;d been no more women since the downfall. Michele had taken a toll on him.<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe I&#x2019;ll get to see her soon, too,&#x201d; he muttered.<br><br>His ex-wife had died two years ago in a car crash.<br><br>That was the last time he and his daughter spoke, her words loud and clear. &#x201c;Get out. She would not want you here.&#x201d;<br><br>And he&#x2019;d left the funeral.<br><br>He stared again at the gun, his finger on the trigger. He steeled himself, grabbed a breath, and nestled the barrel to his temple. He was left-handed, like nearly every Sagan. His uncle, a former professional baseball player, had told him as a child that if he could learn to throw a curveball he&#x2019;d make a fortune in the major leagues. Talented left-handers were rare.<br><br>But he&#x2019;d failed at sports, too.<br><br>He brought the barrel to his temple.<br><br>The metal touched his skin.<br><br>He closed his eyes and tightened his finger on the trigger, imagining how his obituary would start.

Here she widens her <i>You are how you move</i> message and invites us to consider our personal relationship with sedentarism, privilege, and nature. Bowman explores:<br><ul><li> how convenience often means less movement, not more time</li><li> the missing movement nutrients in our food</li><li> how to include more nature in education</li><li> the impact of adding movement to permaculture and ecological models</li><li> our need for vitamin Community and group movement</li></ul> Unapologetically direct, often hilarious, and always compassionate, <i>Movement Matters</i> demonstrates that human movement is powerful and important, and that living a movement-filled life is perhaps the most joyful and efficient way to transform your body, community, and world.</p><p>Partbiomechanist, part science communicator, and full-time mover, Katy Bowman haseducated hundreds of thousands of people on the role movement plays in the bodyand in the world.

She also directs and teaches at the NutritiousMovementTMCenter Northwest in Washington state, travels the globe to teachNutritious Movement courses in person, and spends as much time outside aspossible with her husband and children. <br>&nbsp;Tying together ecological sustainability and modern lifestyles, this book focuses on the science of moving in healthy ways as a means of healing both the earth and the individual. Its heavy emphasis on healthy living generates a necessary bridge between personal well-being and the well-being of the whole environment, and is yet another strong voice in the general call for more active, mindful lifestyle choices.<br>Bowman, a biomechanist, does a fine job communicating the hidden significance of everyday acts, such as walking, sitting, and buying prepared food, in digestible sound bites. This is no dense academic treatise; it is written specifically to appeal to the average person, actively acknowledging commonly asked questions about activity and exercise. As in the case of walking overland versus walking on a treadmill, the author consistently calls for an entire way of life that incorporates movement and activity with being outdoors and interacting with nature. Exercise enthusiasts may find it especially interesting, but the advice seems tailored for the person whose gym membership and office job fail to inspire. It has potential broad reach and should not be ignored when building an alternate health collection.<br>The book is organized as a series of essays and grouped thematically. The three appendices contain useful information for anyone who is inspired by the content. Two of these three are concerned specifically with child rearing. Parenthood is a consistent theme throughout the book, though secondary to movement and ecology. The author introduces several examples that are anecdotal, based on her own children. Citations appear at the conclusion of each essay.<br><i>Movement Matters</i>&nbsp;is a continuation in a popular trend toward a holistic approach to health and ecology. Ideal for nutritionists, fitness experts, and anyone seeking an all-around healthier lifestyle. --Foreword Reviews<br><br> Happily Katy does not get on a moral soapbox about this (or any of the subjects she goes into). She points out that movement outsourcing has been going on since the beginning of agriculture, and that it allows things we appreciate.

Every child is born innocent, but every society corrupts him. Every society, up to now, has been a corruptive influence on every child. All cultures have depended on exploiting the innocence of the child, on exploiting the child, on making him a slave, on conditioning him for their own purposes, for their own ends--political, social, ideological. Their whole effort has been how to recruit the child as a slave for some purpose. Those purposes are decided by the vested interests. The priests and the politicians have been in a deep conspiracy, they have been working together. The moment the child starts becoming part of your society he starts losing something immensely valuable; he starts losing contact with God. He becomes more and more hung up in the head, he forgets all about the heart--and the heart is the bridge that leads to being. Without the heart you cannot reach your own being--it is impossible. From the head there is no way directly to being; you have to go via the heart, and all societies are destructive to the heart. They are against love, they are against feelings; they condemn feelingsas sentimentality. They condemned all lovers down the ages for the simple reason that love is not of the head, it is of the heart. A man who is capable of love is sooner or later going to discover his being--and once a person discovers his being he is free from all structures, from all patterns. He is free from all bondage. He is pure freedom. Every child is born innocent, but every child is made knowledgeable by the society. Hence schools, colleges, universities exist; their function is to destroy you, to corrupt you. From the head there is no way directly to being, you have to go via the heart--and all societies are destructive to the heart. Maturity means gaining your lost innocence again, reclaiming your paradise, becoming a child again. Of course it has a difference--the ordinary child is bound to be corrupted, but when you reclaim your childhood you become incorruptible. Nobody can corrupt you, you become intelligent enough--now you know what the society has done to you and you are alert and aware, you will not allow it to happen again. Maturity is a rebirth, a spiritual birth. You are born anew, you are a child again. With fresh eyes you start looking at existence. With love in the heart you approach life. With silence and innocence you penetrate your own innermost core. You are no longer just the head. Now you use the head, but it is your servant. First you become the heart, and then you transcend even the heart. Going beyond thoughts and feelings and becoming a pure <i>isness</i> is maturity. Maturity is the ultimate flowering of meditation. Jesus says, "Unless you are born again you will not enter into the kingdom of God." He is right, you have to be born again. Once Jesus was standing in a marketplace and somebody asked, "Who is worthy of entering into your kingdom of God?" He looked around. There was a rabbi, and the rabbi must have moved forward a little, thinking that he would be chosen--but he was not chosen. There was the most virtuous man of the town--the moralist, the puritan. He moved forward a little, hoping that he would be chosen, but he was not chosen. Jesus looked around--he saw a small child, who was not expecting to be chosen, who had not moved, not even an inch. There was no idea, there was no question that he would be chosen. He was just enjoying the whole scene--the crowd and Jesus and people talking, and he <i>was</i> listening. Jesus called the child, he took the child up in his arms, and he said to the crowd, "Those who are like this small child, they are the only ones worthy of entering into the kingdom of God." Maturity means gaining your lost innocence again, reclaiming your paradise, becoming a child again. Of course it has a difference--the ordinary child is bound to be corrupted, but when you reclaim your childhood. you become incorruptible. But remember, he said, "Those who are <i>like</i> this smallchild ... ." He didn't say, "Those who are small children." There is a great difference between the two. He did not say, "This child will enter into the kingdom of God," because every child is bound to be corrupted, he has to go astray. Every Adam and every Eve is bound to be expelled from the garden of Eden, they have to go astray. That is the only way to regain real childhood: first you have to lose it. It is very strange, but that's how life is. It is very paradoxical, but life is a paradox. To know the real beauty of your childhood, first you have to lose it; otherwise you will never know it. Every Adam and every Eve is bound to be expelled from the garden of Eden, they have to go astray. That is the only way to regain real childhood: first you have to lose it. The fish never knows where the ocean is--unless you pull the fish out of the ocean and throw it on the sand in the burning sun; then she knows where the ocean is. Now she longs for the ocean, she makes every effort to go back to the ocean, she jumps into the ocean. It is the same fish and yet not the same fish. It is the same ocean yet not the same ocean, because the fish has learned a new lesson. Now she is aware, now she knows, "This is the ocean and this is my life. Without it I am no more--I am part of it." Every child has to lose his innocence and regain it. Losing is only half of the process--many have lost it, but very few have regained it. That is unfortunate, very unfortunate. Everybody loses it, but only once in a while does a Buddha, a Zarathustra, a Krishna,a Jesus regain it. Jesus is nobody else but Adam coming back home. Magdalene is nobody else but Eve coming back home. They have come out of the sea and they have seen the misery and they have seen the stupidity. They have seen that it is not blissful to be out of the ocean. The moment you become aware that to be a part of any society, any religion, any culture is to remain miserable, is to remain a prisoner--that very day you start dropping your chains. Maturity is coming, you are gaining your innocence again. MATURITY AND AGING There is a great difference between maturity and aging, a vast difference, and people always remain confused about it. People think that to age is to become mature--but aging belongs to the body. Everybody is aging, everybody will become old, but not necessarily mature. Maturity is an inner growth. Aging is nothing that you do, aging is something that happens physically. Every child born, when time passes, becomes old. Maturity is something that you bring to your life--it comes out of awareness. When a person ages with full awareness, he becomes mature. Aging plus awareness, experiencing plus awareness, is maturity. You can experience a thing in two ways. You can simply experience it as if you are hypnotized, unaware, not attentive to what is happening; the thing happened but you were not there. It didn't happen in your presence, you were absent. You just passed by, it never struck any note in you. It never left any mark on you, younever learned anything from it. It may have become part of your memory, because in a way you were present, but it never became your wisdom. You never grew through it. Then you are aging. But if you bring the quality of awareness to an experience the same experience becomes maturity. Aging is nothing that you do, aging is something that happens physically. Every child born, when time passes becomes old. Maturity is something that you bring to your life-it comes out of awareness. There are two ways to live: one, to live in a deep sleep--then you age, every moment you become old, every moment you go on dying, that's all. Your whole life consists of a long, slow death. But if you bring awareness to your experiences--whatsoever you do, whatsoever happens to you, you are alert, watchful, mindful, you are savoring the experience from all the corners, you are trying to understand the meaning of it, you are trying to penetrate the very depth of it, what has happened to you, you are trying to live it intensely and totally--then it is not just a surface phenomenon. Deep down within you something is changing with it. You are becoming more alert. If this is a mistake, this experience, you will never commit it again. A mature person never commits the same mistake again. But a person who is just old goes on committing the same mistakes again and again. He lives in a circle; he never learns anything. You will be angry today, you were angry yesterday and the day before yesterday,and tomorrow you are going to be angry and the day after tomorrow also. Again and again you get angry, again and again you repent, again and again you make a deep decision that you are not going to do it again. But that decision makes no change--whenever you are disturbed the rage takes over, you are possessed; the same mistake is committed. You are aging. If you live an experience of anger totally, never again will you be angry. One experience will be enough to teach that it is foolish, that it is absurd, that it is simply stupid--not that it is a sin, it is simply stupid. You are harming yourself and harming others, for nothing. The thing is not worth it. Then you are getting mature. Tomorrow the situation will be repeated but anger will not be repeated. And a man who is gaining in maturity has not <i>decided</i> that he will not be angry again, no--that is the sign of a man who is not getting mature. A man of maturity never decides for the future; the maturity itself takes care. You live today--that very living will decide how the tomorrow is going to be; it will come out of it. A mature person never commits the same mistake again. But a person who is just old goes on committing the same mistakes again and again. He lives in a circle, he never learns anything. If the anger was painful, poisonous, you suffered hell through it, what is the point of deciding or taking a vow and going to the temple and declaring, "Now I take a vow that I will never be angry again"? All this is childish, there is no point! If you have knownthat anger is poisonous, it is finished! That way is closed, that door no longer exists for you. The situation will be repeated tomorrow but you will not be possessed by the situation. You have learned something--that understanding will be there. You may even laugh, you may even enjoy the whole thing of how people get so foolish. Your understanding is growing through every experience. You can live life as if you are in hypnosis--that's how ninety-nine percent of people live--or you can live with intensity, awareness. If you live with awareness, you mature; otherwise you simply become old. And to become old is not to become wise. If you have been a fool when you were young and now you have become old, you will be just an old fool, that's all. Just becoming old, you cannot become wise. You may be even more foolish because you may have clung to mechanical habits, robotlike. A man of maturity never decides for the future, the maturity itself takes care. You live today--that very living will decide how the tomorrow is going to be, it will come out of it. Life can be lived in two ways. If you live unconsciously you simply die; if you live consciously you attain more and more life. Death will come--but it never comes to a mature man, it comes only to a man who has been aging and getting old. A mature person never dies, because he will learn even through death. Even death is going to be an experience to be intensely lived, and watched, allowed. A mature man never dies. In fact, on the rock of maturity death struggles and shatters itself, commits suicide. Death dies, but nevera mature man. That is the message of all the awakened ones, that you are deathless. They have known it, they have lived their death. They have watched and they have found that it can surround you but you remain aloof, you remain far away. Death happens near you but it never happens to you. Deathless is your being, blissful is your being, divine is your being, but those experiences you cannot cram into the mind and the memory. You have to pass through life and attain them. Much suffering is there, much pain is there. And because of pain and suffering people like to live stupidly--it has to be understood why so many people insist that they should live in hypnosis, why Buddhas and Christs go on telling people to be awake, and nobody listens. There must be some deep involvement in the hypnosis, there must be some deep investment. What is the investment? To become old is not to become wise. If you have been a fool when you were young and now you have become old, you will be just an old fool, that's all. The mechanism has to be understood; otherwise you will listen to me and you will never become aware. You will listen and you will make it a part of your knowledge, that "Yes, this man says be aware and it is good to be aware, and those who attain to awareness become mature ... ." But you yourself will not attain to it, it will remain just knowledge. You may communicate your knowledge to others, but nobody is helped that way. Why? Have you ever asked this question? Why don't you attain to awareness? If it leads to the infinite bliss, to the attainment of <i>satchitananda,</i> to absolute truth--then why not be aware? Why do you insist on being sleepy? There is some investment, and this is the investment: if you become aware, there is suffering. If you become aware, you become aware of pain, and the pain is so much that you would like to take a tranquilizer and be asleep. This sleepiness in life works as a protection against pain. But this is the trouble--if you are asleep against pain, you are asleep against pleasure also. Think of it as if there are two faucets: on one is written "pain" and on the other is written "pleasure." You would like to close the faucet on which pain is written, and you would like to open the faucet on which pleasure is written. But this is the game--if you close the pain faucet the pleasure faucet immediately closes, because behind both there is only one faucet, on which "awareness" is written. Either both remain open or both remain closed, because both are two faces of the same phenomenon, two aspects. A mature person never dies, because he will learn even through death. Even death is going to be an experience to be intensely lived, and watched, allowed. And this is the whole contradiction of mind: mind wants to be more and more happy--happiness is possible if you are aware. And then mind wants to be less and less in pain--but less and less pain is possible only if you are <i>unaware.</i> Now you are in a dilemma. If you want no pain, immediately pleasure disappears from your life, happiness disappears. If you want happiness you open the faucet--immediately there is pain also flowing. If you are aware, you have to be aware of both. Life ispain and pleasure. Life is happiness and unhappiness. Life is day and night, life is life and death. You have to be aware of both. So remember it. If you are afraid of pain you will remain in hypnosis; you will age, become old, and die. You missed an opportunity. If you want to be aware then you have to be aware of both pain and pleasure; they are not separate phenomena. And a man who becomes aware becomes very happy but also becomes capable of deep unhappiness, of which you are not capable.

They did not die to save civilization; they were killed for profit and in the hopes of establishing a one-world government. By 1917, America had been thrust into the war by a President who promised to stay out of the conflict. But the real power behind the war consisted of the bankers, the financiers, and the politicians, referred to, in this book, as The Secret Elite. Scouring government papers on both sides of the Atlantic, memoirs that avoided the censor&#x2019;s pen, speeches made in Congress and Parliament, major newspapers of the time, and other sources, <i>Prolonging the Agony</i> maintains that the war was deliberately and unnecessarily prolonged and that the gross lies ingrained in modern &#x201c;histories&#x201d; still circulate because governments refuse citizens the truth. Featured in this book are shocking accounts of the alleged Belgian &#x201c;outrages,&#x201d; the sinking of the Lusitania, the manipulation of votes for Herbert Hoover, Lord Kitchener&#x2019;s death, and American and British zionists in cahoots with Rothschild's manipulated Balfour Declaration.

Stone charts Nixon&#x2019;s rise from election to Congress in 1946 to the White House in 1968 after his razor-thin loss to John Kennedy in 1960, his disastrous campaign for Governor of California in 1962 and the greatest comeback in American Presidential history.<br><br> Just as the assassination of JFK prevents a balanced analysis of Kennedy and his times, the myth of Watergate prevents a reappraisal of our 37th President.&#x201d; said Stone who&#x2019;s book on LBJ was the second biggest selling book during the 50th anniversary of Kennedy&#x2019;s murder.<br><br>Stone reveals how the Kennedy&#x2019;s wiretapped Nixon&#x2019;s hotel room the night before the Nixon-Kennedy debate, and stole Nixon's medical records from his psychiatrist&#x2019;s office. Stone lays out how Kennedy running mate Lyndon Johnson stole Texas from JFK through vote fraud while Mayor Richard Daley stole Illinois, and how JFK actually lost the popular vote. <br><br>Stone looks at the Nixon Presidency: the desegregation of the public schools, the progressive social programs, Nixon's struggle to end the war in Vietnam, the historic SALT arms reduction agreement with Russia, the saving of Israel in the Six Days War, the opening to China, and the disastrous decision to take America off the Gold standard.<br><br> The mainstream media&#x2019;s interpretation of the facts surrounding the Watergate episode are a fantastic and grotesque distortion of historical truth,&#x201d; said Stone. Cursory examination of the facts in Watergate will reveal that the actions which caused the fall of Nixon cannot be reduced to the simplistic account summarized by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein of the Washington Post.&#x201d;<br><br>The author outlines how White House Counsel John Dean, planned, pushed and covered-up the Watergate break-in , then sought to avoid responsibility for it. Stone examines the bungled Watergate break-in to determine what exactly Nixon&#x2019;s agents were looking for and how the CIA infiltrated the burglar team and sabotaged the break-in to gain leverage over Nixon. Find out why Nixon demanded the CIA turn over the records of the Bay of Pigs and Kennedy Assassination.<br><br>Learn how a cabal of military and intelligence hard-liners spied on and<br>undermined Nixon to stop his pro-peace d�tente foreign policy, his withdrawal of troops from Vietnam, his arms limitation agreement with the Soviets, and his opening to Red China. Discover how Vice President Spiro Agnew was setup to move him out of the line of presidential succession. <br><br>Stone makes the compelling case that General Alexander Haig orchestrated Nixon&#x2019;s removal from office in a coup d&#x2019;�tat and brokered the deal for his pardon. Finally the public will learn what is on the 18 � minute gap in the White House Tapes.<br><br>Stone, a Washington Insider for forty years, outlines why FBI Man Mark Felt is not deep throat, why there is no deep throat, and why Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein lie about it even today.<br><br>Stone reveals how Nixon used the dark secrets he knew to avoid prosecution by blackmailing Gerald Ford for a full, free and unconditional pardon. Nixon&#x2019;s secret would not only destroy his presidency it would save him from prison and allow him to launch his final comeback advising President Bill Clinton on Foreign Affairs despite Hillary&#x2019;s attempts to block him and her being fired from the 1974 House Impeachment Committee for lying and violating Nixon&#x2019;s rights.<br><br>Skyhorse Publishing, as well as our Arcade imprint, are proud to publish a broad range of books for readers interested in history--books about World War II, the Third Reich, Hitler and his henchmen, the JFK assassination, conspiracies, the American Civil War, the American Revolution, gladiators, Vikings, ancient Rome, medieval times, the old West, and much more.

He is a legendary political operative who served as a senior campaign aide to Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and Senator Bob Dole, and is a close friend and adviser to President Donald Trump. Stone would parlay being the youngest staff member of the Committee to Re-Elect the President into being a confidant and adviser to the ex-president.

Stone makes it clear that he hasn't written a sanitized version of Nixon's political life, 'nor is it an attempt to rehabilitate his reputation. Don't expect a whitewash of Nixon's sins because 'no man is a hero to his valet.' On balance, he conclude that Nixon's greatness and his vision for a global political realignment to achieve world peace must be viewed as well as his numerous mistakes."<br><br> Nancy Smith, Executive Editor at <i>Sunshine State News</i><br><br>"Stone, a hard-ball player exposes John Dean as a self-serving liar who planned, pushed and covered up the Watergate Break in for his own agenda. Stone builds on the work of Len Colodny, James Hougan, Douglas Caddy, James Rosen and Phil Stanford to prove Dean is the real weasel of Watergate."<br><br> <i>The Broward Bugle</i><br><br>"All in all, this book certainly merits a five star, excellent review for the wealth of new information it contains. It certainly clears up a lot of remaining questions as to "what really happened" in the Watergate case, mostly caused by a lot of confusion and misdirection owed into the story by Messrs, Woodward, and Bernstein. Above all else, the book sets the record straight in relation to the prevarications of John Dean, as when he called Dean's book (misnamed <i>The Nixon Defense</i>) 'an all-out attack on President Nixon.' It's far more accurate to see the book as Dean's defense, his last and best effort to paint a picture of how an innocent young lawyer suddenly and unexpectedly found himself in the midst of a cabal of evil-doers--and how he alone struggled to do the right thing...<br><br>Do not be put off by the reviews that complain of poor editing; there are a few redundancies and a misspelling or grammar error here and there but to state that these discredit the book is such overkill that it seems more like the kind of whining that one resorts to when there is nothing more substantive to say. In some of these cases, in fact, it is necessary to repeat, or refer to, a past reference maybe 50 pages back, in order to make another point and that should not be considered a 'redundancy' as I think some have done."<br><br> Phillip F.

Reading the Old Testament is not enough, writes Matthias Henze in this slender volume aimed at the student of the Bible. To understand the Jews of the Second Temple period, it's essential to read what they wrote and what Jesus and his followers might have read beyond the Hebrew scriptures. Henze introduces the four-century gap between the Old and New Testaments and some of the writings produced during this period (different Old Testaments, the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha, the Dead Sea Scrolls); discusses how these texts have been read from the Reformation to the present, emphasizing the importance of the discovery of Qumran; guides the student's encounter with select texts from each collection; and then introduces key ideas found in specific New Testament texts that simply can't be understood without these early Jewish "intertestamental" writings the Messiah, angels and demons, the law, and the resurrection of the dead. Finally, he discusses the role of these writings in the "parting of the ways" between Judaism and Christianity. Mind the Gap broadens curious students' perspectives on early Judaism and early Christianity and welcomes them to deeper study.</p></p><p><p>Matthias Henze is Isla Carroll and Perry E. Turner Professor of Hebrew Bible and early Judaism and founding director of the program in Jewish studies at Rice University. He has written or edited books on biblical interpretation at Qumran and early Judaism and on various early Jewish writings, including the coauthored <i>4 Ezra and 2 Baruch: Translations, Introductions, and Notes</i> (Fortress Press, 2013).</p></p><h2>The Way Some People Die (Lew Archer Series)</h2><p>In a rundown house in Santa Monica, Mrs. Samuel Lawrence presses fifty crumpled bills into Lew Archer's hand and asks him to find her wandering daughter, Galatea. Described as &#x2018;crazy for men&#x2019; and without discrimination, she was last seen driving off with small-time gangster Joe Tarantine, a hophead hood with a rep for violence. Archer traces the hidden trail from San Francisco slum alleys to the luxury of Palm Springs, traveling through an urban wilderness of drugs and viciousness. As the bodies begin to pile up, he finds that even angel faces can mask the blackest of hearts.Filled with dope, delinquents and murder, this is classic Macdonald and one of his very best in the Lew Archer series.</p><p><b>Ross Macdonald's</b> real name was Kenneth Millar. Born near San Francisco in 1915 and raised in Vancouver, British Columbia, Millar returned to the U.S. as a young man and published his first novel in 1944. He served as the president of the Mystery Writers of America and was awarded their Grand Master Award as well as the Mystery Writers of Great Britain's Silver Dagger Award. He died in 1983.CHAPTER 1:The house was in Santa Monica on a cross street between the boulevards, within earshot of the coast highway and rifleshot of the sea. The street was the kind that people had once been proud to live on, but in the last few years it had lost its claim to pride. The houses had too many stories, too few windows, not enough paint. Their history was easy to guess: they were one-family residences broken up into apartments and light-housekeeping rooms, or converted into tourist homes. Even the palms that lined the street looked as if they had seen their best days and were starting to lose their hair.I parked in front of the number I had been given and leaned sideways in the seat to have a look at the house. The numerals, 1348, were made of rusted metal and tacked diagonally across one of the round porch pillars. A showcard above, printed black on white, offered ROOMS FOR TOURISTS. There were several rattan chairs and a faded green glider on the porch, which covered the width of the house. A second-story porch, with more rattan, was surrounded by a wooden railing that looked unsafe. The third story had Gothic-looking towers at each corner, fake battlements that time had taken and made ridiculous. The roller blinds were low over the windows on all three levels, so they stared at me sleepy-eyed.The house didn&#39;t look as if it had money in it, or ever would have again. I went in anyway, because I&#39;d liked the woman&#39;s voice on the telephone.She came to the door in a hurry when I knocked. A tall woman in her fifties with worried vague dark eyes in a worried long face, a black crepe dress over a thick corseted body. A detective was an occasion in her life. Her iron-gray hair was set in a sharp new wave that smelt of the curling-iron, her nose and cheeks and chin were stark with powder. The light fell through the purple glass in the fanlight over the door and made her complexion livid.The woman&#39;s voice was her best feature, gentle and carefully modulated, in a low register: &#34;I&#39;m Mrs. Samuel Lawrence. You&#39;re Mr. Archer, of course? You got here in no time at all.&#34;&#34;The traffic&#39;s not so bad between nine and ten.&#34;&#34;Come in, Mr. Archer. Let me make you a cup of tea. I&#39;m just having a midmorning snack myself. Since I&#39;ve been doing all my own work, I find I need a bite between meals to sustain me.&#34;I stepped inside, and the screen door swung to languidly behind me. The hall was still and cool and smelt of wax. The floor was old parquetry, and its polished patterns glowed like jewels. A carpeted stairway climbed to the high dim ceiling. An ancient oak hatstand with polished brass hangers stood at the foot of the stairs. The contrast with the traffic I&#39;d been fighting gave me a queer feeling, as if I&#39;d stepped backward in time, or out of it entirely.She led me to an open door at the rear. &#34;This is my own little sitting-room, if you please. I reserve the front parlor for guests, though I must say they haven&#39;t been using it lately. Of course it&#39;s the off-season, I only have the three just now, my regular, and a lovely young couple from Oregon, honeymooners! If only Galley had married a man like that--but sit down, Mr. Archer.&#34;She pulled out a chair from the heavy refectory table in the middle of the room. It was a small room, and it was as crowded with coffee- and end-tables, chairs and hassocks and bookcases, as a second-hand furniture store. The horizontal surfaces were littered with gewgaws, shells and framed photographs, vases and pincushions and doilies. If the lady had come down in the world, she&#39;d brought a lot down with her. My sensation of stepping into the past was getting too strong for comfort. The half-armed chair closed on me like a hand.I took the present by the tail and dragged it into the room: &#34;Galley,&#34; I said. &#34;Is she the daughter you mentioned?&#34;The question struck her like an accusation, disorganizing her charm. She didn&#39;t like the look of the present at all. She faced it when she had to, with a face clouded by bewilderment and shame. &#34;Yes. My daughter Galatea. It&#39;s why I phoned you, as I said.&#34; Her gaze wandered, and lighted on the teapot that stood on the table. &#34;You must let me pour you some tea before we get down to business. It&#39;s freshly made.&#34;Her hand on the teapot was cracked and grained by dirty work, but she poured with an air. I said I took mine straight. The tea tasted like a clear dark dripping from the past. My grandmother came back with it, in crisp black funeral silks, and I looked out of the window to dispel her. I could see the Santa Monica pier from where I sat, and beyond it the sea and the sky like the two curved halves of a blue Easter egg.&#34;Nice view you have from here.&#34;She smiled over her teacup. &#34;Yes. I bought it for the view. I shouldn&#39;t really say I&#39;ve bought it. It&#39;s mortgaged, after all.&#34;I finished my tea and set the thin white cup in the thin white saucer. &#34;Well, Mrs. Lawrence, let&#39;s have it. What happened to your daughter?&#34;&#34;I don&#39;t know,&#34; she said. &#34;That&#39;s what upsets me so. She simply disappeared a couple of months ago--&#34;&#34;From here?&#34;&#34;No, not from here. Galley hasn&#39;t lived at home in recent years, though she always came to visit me at least once a month. She was working in Pacific Point, a special-duty nurse in the hospital there. I always hoped for something better for Galley--my husband Dr. Lawrence was a medical man, and a very well respected one, too--but she wanted to be a nurse and she seemed to be very happy in the work--&#34;She was veering away from the present fact again. &#34;When did she disappear?&#34;&#34;Last December, a few days before Christmas.&#34; This was the middle of March, which made it about three months. &#34;Galley always came home for Christmas. We never failed to decorate a tree. Last Christmas for the first time I spent Christmas by myself. Even her card came a day late.&#34; And the vague eyes swam with self-pity.&#34;If you&#39;ve heard from her, I wouldn&#39;t call it a disappearance. Can I have a look at the card?&#34;&#34;Of course.&#34; She took a black leather volume of Swedenborg out of the bookcase, opened it, and drew out a large square envelope which she handed to me as if it contained a check. &#34;But she has disappeared, Mr. Archer. I haven&#39;t seen her since early in December. None of her friends has seen her since the first of the year.&#34;&#34;How old is she?&#34;&#34;Twenty-four. She&#39;ll be twenty-five next month, April the 9th, if she&#39;s alive.&#34; She bowed her face in her hands, having brought herself to tears.&#34;She&#39;ll probably have many happy returns,&#34; I said. &#34;A twenty-five-year-old registered nurse can look after herself.&#34;&#34;You don&#39;t know Galley,&#34; the damp voice said from the hidden face. &#34;She&#39;s always been so fascinating to men, and she&#39;s never realized how evil men can be. I&#39;ve tried to unknow the error, but it does no good. I keep thinking of the Black Dahlia, all the young girls that have been stolen away and destroyed by evil men.&#34; The wide gold wedding band on the hand over her face gleamed dully like a despairing hope.I took out the card, which was large and expensive, decorated with a sparkling mica snow scene. Inside it said:TO MOTHER ON CHRISTMAS DAYThough my boat has left the harborIn the sea of life so wide,I think with cheer of Mother DearEach joyous Christmastide.It was subscribed in green ink by a bold and passionate hand: &#34;Much love, Galley.&#34; The envelope had been mailed in San Francisco on December 24.&#34;Did--does your daughter have friends in San Francisco?&#34;&#34;Not that I know of.&#34; The woman showed me her face, with tear-tracks in the powder. She blew her nose discreetly in a piece of pink Kleenex. &#34;The last few years, since she graduated, I didn&#39;t really know her friends.&#34;&#34;Do you think she&#39;s in San Francisco?&#34;&#34;I don&#39;t know. She came back from there, you see. She didn&#39;t come to me, but the man who runs the apartments down there, a Mr. Raisch, saw her. She had a small furnished apartment in Pacific Point, and about the end of December she turned up there and moved out, took away all her things. There was a man with her.&#34;&#34;What sort of a man?&#34;&#34;Mr. Raisch didn&#39;t say. There seemed to be some kind of secret about the man--something sinister.&#34;&#34;Is that a fact, or only your impression?&#34;&#34;My impression. I suppose I&#39;ve been too open to impression, lately. I can&#39;t tell you what my life has been these last few weeks. I&#39;ve gone down to Pacific Point on the bus half a dozen times, whenever I could get away. I&#39;ve talked to the nurses that knew her at the hospital. She hasn&#39;t been near the hospital since before Christmas, when she finished her last case. It was a man named Speed who had been shot in the stomach. The police came to question him, and he nearly died. The people at the hospital seemed to think that this Speed person was a gangster. That&#39;s one of the things that frightens me. I&#39;ve hardly slept a wink for weeks and weeks.&#34; There were deep bluish hollows under her eyes, pitiable and ugly in the morning light from the window.&#34;Actually, though,&#34; I said, &#34;You&#39;ve got nothing concrete to be afraid about.&#34;&#34;My only daughter is gone--&#34;&#34;Girls leave home all the time. It tears the hearts out of their mothers, but they don&#39;t know it. They don&#39;t find out till their own kids grow up and do it to them. She probably ran off and married this man that was with her at the apartment.&#34;&#34;That&#39;s what Mr. Raisch thought. Still Galley wouldn&#39;t marry without letting me know. Besides, I&#39;ve checked the registrations in Pacific Point, and Los Angeles as well, and there is no record of a marriage.&#34;&#34;That doesn&#39;t prove a thing. You can fly to New York or Hawaii in a day.&#34; I took a cigarette from a pack in my pocket and automatically asked her: &#34;Mind if I smoke?&#34;Her face froze, as if I had suggested an obscenity. &#34;Smoke if you must, sir. I know what a hold the nicotine habit has on its victims. Dr. Lawrence was a smoker for years, until he finally broke free, with God&#39;s help.&#34;I replaced the cigarette in my pocket and stood up to leave. Even with a million dollars, she wouldn&#39;t have been the kind of woman I wanted to work for. And she probably didn&#39;t have two nickels to rub against each other. As for the daughter, ten to one she&#39;d simply decided to have a life of her own.I put it less bluntly to her: &#34;I think you should take it to Missing Persons, Mrs. Lawrence. I don&#39;t think you have anything to worry about, but if you have, they can do more for you than I can. It would be a waste of money to hire me. I charge fifty a day and expenses. The police do everything free.&#34;Her answer surprised me: &#34;I expected to pay you well. And I am not going to go to the police.&#34;&#34;Why not? Missing daughters are their specialty. They&#39;ve got a national system set up to find them.&#34;Grim bony lines came out in her face, and her eyes weren&#39;t vague any more. &#34;If Galley is living in sin with some man, it&#39;s nobody&#39;s business but my own.&#34;&#34;Aren&#39;t you jumping to conclusions?&#34;&#34;I tell you you don&#39;t know Galley. Men have been after her since high school, like flies to honey. She&#39;s a good girl, Mr. Archer, I know how good. But I was a handsome girl myself when I was young, and I&#39;ve seen the pitfalls of the flesh. I want to know what has happened to my daughter.&#34;I stood by the table and lit my cigarette and dropped the match on the tea tray. She didn&#39;t say a word. After a stretching moment of silence, she reached from her chair and took a framed photograph from the top of the bookcase. &#34;Look at her, you&#39;ll understand what I mean.&#34;I took the picture from her hand. There was something slightly shady about the transaction, a faint implication that she was offering her daughter&#39;s beauty as part payment on my services. Or maybe I was having impressions. I had one when I looked at the girl&#39;s face. It was passionate and bold like her handwriting. Even in a white nurse&#39;s cap and a high chaste collar she was a girl you saw once and never forgot.&#34;It was her graduation picture, taken three years ago, but she still looks exactly the same. Isn&#39;t she pretty?&#34;Pretty was hardly the word. With her fierce curled lips, black eyes and clean angry bones she must have stood out in her graduating class like a chicken hawk in a flock of pullets.&#34;If you want to spend fifty dollars,&#34; I said, &#34;I&#39;ll go down to Pacific Point today and see what I can find out. Write down her last address and the name of whoever you talked to at the hospital.&#34;With the caution of a pheasant hen returning to her nest, she went to an old-fashioned sewing machine by the window, lifted the closed top and removed a worn black purse from its hiding place. Opening the tarnished clasp, she rummaged in the purse and counted five reluctant tens onto the table.Dropping my ashes in my empty teacup, I noticed the arrangement of the leaves. My grandmother would have said it meant money and a dark stranger. The stranger could have been male or female, vertical or horizontal, depending on how you looked at the bottom of the cup.CHAPTER 2:I drove south through Long Beach to Pacific Point. Crossing the mesa that flanked it to the northwest, you could see the town spread out, from the natural harbor half-enclosed by the curving finger of land that gave the place its name, to the houses on the ridge above the fogline. It rose from sea level in a gentle slope, divided neatly into social tiers, like something a sociologist had built to prove a theory. Tourists and transients lived in hotels and motels along the waterfront. Behind them a belt of slums lay ten blocks deep, where the darker half of the population lived and died. On the other side of the tracks--the tracks were there--the business section wore its old Spanish facades like icing on a stale cake. The people who worked in the stores and offices inhabited the grid of fifty-foot lots that covered the next ten blocks. On the slopes above them the owners and managers enjoyed their patios and barbecue pits. And along the top of the ridge lived the really wealthy, who had bought their pieds-a-terre in Pacific Point because it reminded them of Juan-les-Pins.</p><h2>I Like Myself!

The harsh geographical conditions and sheer size of the country prevented the creation of participatory government, and a &#x201c;patrimonial&#x201d; state emerged in which Russia was transformed into a gigantic royal domain. Richard Pipes traces these developments and goes on to analyze the political behavior of the principal social groupings&#x2014;peasantry, nobility, middle-class, and clergy&#x2014;and their failure to stand up to the increasing absolutism of the tsar. In order to strengthen his powers, legal and institutional bases were set up that led to the creation of a bureaucratic police state under the Communists. <br><br> &#x201c;A brilliant and provocative analysis . . . learned, judicious, witty and full of common sense.&#x201d;&#x2014;John Keep, <i>The Times Literary Supplement<br></i><br> &#x201c;A lively, profound, often extremely subtle account of the making of the Russian state . . .

From May 1940 to December 1941, the leaders of the world?s six major powers made a series of related decisions that determined the final outcome of World War II and shaped the course of human destiny. As the author examines the connected stories of these profound choices, he restores a sense of drama and contingency to this pivotal moment, producing one of the freshest, most important books on World War II in years?one with powerful contemporary relevance.</p><p><b>Ian Kershaw</b>,&nbsp;author of&nbsp;<i>To Hell and Back</i>,&nbsp;<i>The End, Fateful Choices,&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Making Friends with Hitler,&nbsp;</i>is a British historian of twentieth-century Germany noted for his monumental biographies of Adolf Hitler. In 2002, he received his knighthood for services to history. He is a fellow of the British Academy, the Royal Historical Society, the Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin, and the Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung in Bonn, Germany.Reviewed by Vince Rinehart<p> World War II made for great myths and great mythmakers. Consider this one, from Winston Churchill: "Future generations may deem it noteworthy that the supreme question of whether we should fight on alone never found a place upon the War Cabinet agenda." </p><p> In fact, from May 25 to 28, 1940, while the entire British Expeditionary Force was threatened with destruction at Dunkirk, Churchill and his war cabinet engaged in an intense debate over whether to seek detente by approaching Adolf Hitler through Italy's Benito Mussolini. Would a negotiated end to the war be possible? The foreign minister, Lord Halifax, forcefully advocated exploring the possibilities; Churchill passionately argued to the contrary and won, with crucial support from Neville Chamberlain, not often associated with such steadfastness. Even then, the war cabinet "did not rule out the possibility of an approach to Mussolini 'at some time,' though it explicitly did so in the current situation," writes Ian Kershaw in Fateful Choices, his ambitious history of the war's most important decisions. "It is not easy to imagine, in the light of later events, how insecure Churchill's position was in the middle of May 1940. His hold on authority, soon to become unchallengeable, was still tenuous." </p><p>That decision and nine others are the subjects of searching, careful -- sometimes pedantic -- analysis, drawing on a wealth of primary sources and bibliography, detailed in copious endnotes and a list of works cited. Kershaw, the author of Making Friends with Hitler and an acclaimed two-volume biography of the dictator, writes with deep command of his material, weaving together the consequences that each decision had on those that followed. The other decisions involve Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union; Japan's targeting of British, French and Dutch possessions in Southeast Asia; Mussolini's entry into the war and the subsequent invasion of Greece; Roosevelt opting to aid Britain and, later, to wage an undeclared naval war; Stalin ignoring the clear signs of the impending German attack; Japan choosing war with the United States; and two last choices by Hitler, to declare war on the United States and to give genocide against the Jews of Europe its final, monstrous shape. </p><p>Within 483 pages of text, that's a lot to get through, and for that reason Fateful Choices sometimes feels like a college textbook's survey history. At times the chewy prose is very slow slogging. Kershaw's analysis centers on the process of decision making, the war of memos and meetings and -- particularly with Hitler, Stalin and Mussolini -- the influence of personality and absolute power in leading up to disastrous choices. He briskly sums up Mussolini's orders to invade Greece: "What passed for dictatorial decisiveness was in reality the merest veneer of half-baked assumptions, superficial observations, amateurish judgement and wholly uncritical assessment, all based upon the best-case scenario." </p><p>Nothing truly revelatory there, and that is the case with some of the other decisions, including Japan's long path to the Tripartite Pact and war with the United States. In fact, Kershaw's unraveling of that decision and a few others seems to undermine a premise of the book, that "there was no inexorable path to be followed." The Japan of his history was at a watershed moment in a decades-old path toward great-power status and its own colonial empire, with a military that answered only to the emperor and was ruled as much by fanatical mid-rank officers as by its generals and admirals. It was trapped in a war in China and faced an uncompromising, rearming United States. Kershaw's portrait of Japanese leaders is almost poignant; all, including the emperor, were fatalistic about their chances of winning the war without an immediate knockout blow. At the same time, they were utterly convinced that the only alternative to war was national humiliation and subservience. The real choices here, as Kershaw notes, were made over decades, with the support of much of the Japanese public; by 1940, Japanese leaders were largely in a straitjacket not entirely of their own making.</p><p>The last decision Kershaw explores -- moving to the industrial-scale murder of Europe's Jews -- wasn't so much a decision as the endpoint of a long trajectory of anti-Semitism that found its ultimate exponent in Hitler and its impetus in the speed of his victories in 1940 and 1941. This final chapter is a horrifying chronicle of the "spiral of radicalization" in Nazi thinking that led from Mein Kampf to Auschwitz-Birkenau. It is a fitting coda to Kershaw's thoughtful, far-reaching examination of events that echo down to today. </p><p>Copyright 2007, The Washington Post.

They make claims on us: they command, oblige, recommend, or guide. But where does their authority over us come from? Christine Korsgaard identifies and examines four accounts of the source of normativity that have been advocated by modern moral philosophers--voluntarism, realism, reflective endorsement, and the appeal to autonomy--and shows how Kant&#39;s autonomy-based account emerges as a synthesis of the other three. Her discussion is followed by commentary from G.A.

Using a historical and comparative perspective, it demonstrates that there is more than one business model of human trafficking and that there are enormous variations in human trafficking in different regions of the world. Drawing on a wide body of academic research - actual prosecuted cases, diverse reports, and field work and interviews conducted by the author over the last sixteen years in Asia, Latin America, Africa, Europe, and the former socialist countries - Louise Shelley concludes that human trafficking will grow in the twenty-first century as a result of economic and demographic inequalities in the world, the rise of conflicts, and possibly global climate change. Coordinated efforts of government, civil society, the business community, multilateral organizations, and the media are needed to stem its growth.</p><p>This book examines all forms of human trafficking globally, revealing the operations of the trafficking business and the nature of the traffickers themselves.

After Columbus&#x2019;s death in 1506, the eighteen-year-old Hernando sought to continue&#x2014;and surpass&#x2014;his father&#x2019;s campaign to explore the boundaries of the known world by building a library that would collect everything ever printed: a vast holding organized by summaries and catalogues, the first ever search engine for the exploding diversity of written matter as the printing press proliferated across Europe. Hernando restlessly and obsessively amassed his collection based on the groundbreaking conviction that a library of universal knowledge should include &#x201c;all books, in all languages and on all subjects,&#x201d; even material often dismissed as ephemeral trash: song sheets, erotica, newsletters, popular images, romances, fables. The loss of part of his collection to another maritime disaster in 1522&#x2014;documented in his poignant <i>Catalogue of Shipwrecked Books</i>&#x2014;set off the final scramble to complete this sublime project, a race against time to realize a vision of near-impossible perfection.<br> <br> Edward Wilson-Lee&#x2019;s account of Hernando&#x2019;s life is a testimony to the beautiful madness of booklovers, a plunge into sixteenth-century Europe&#x2019;s information revolution, and a reflection of the passion and intrigues that lie beneath our own attempts to bring order to the world today.</p><p>Edward Wilson-Lee is a Fellow in English at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, where he teaches medieval and Renaissance literature.

It was an hour before sunrise on Wednesday, the twenty-fifth of September 1493. He was standing next to his older half brother, Diego, looking out at the harbor of Cadiz. Dancing on the water in front of him was a constellation of lamps, on and above the decks of seventeen ships about to weigh anchor, preparing to return to the islands in the west where their father had first made landfall less than a year before. Christopher Columbus was now the &#x201c;Admiral of the Ocean Sea&#x201d; and was of sufficient fame that chroniclers took down each detail of the scene in front of the five-year-old Hernando. The fleet was formed of a number of lighter craft from Cantabria in the north of Spain, vessels made with wooden joinery so as not to be weighed down with iron nails, as well as the slower but more durable caravels. On board the ships were thirteen hundred souls, including artisans of every sort and laborers to reap the miraculous and uninterrupted harvests of which Columbus had told, but also well-bred caballeros who went for adventure rather than work.1<br> <br>A favorable wind had begun to freshen, and as the dawn grew behind the city, the dots of lamplight would slowly have been connected by the cabins and masts and riggings to which they were fixed. The scene and the mood were triumphant: tapestries hung from the sides of the ships and pennants fluttered from the braided cables, while the sterns were draped in the royal ensigns of the Reyes Cat�licos (Catholic Monarchs), Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile, the great sovereigns whose marriage had united a fragmented Spain. The piercing fanfare of hautboys, bagpipes, trumpets, and clarions was so loud, according to one observer, that the Sirens and the spirits of the water were astonished, and the seabed resounded with the cannonades. At the harbor mouth a Venetian convoy, returning from a trade mission to Britain, augmented the noise with their own gunpowder salutes, preparing to follow Columbus part of the way in the hope of learning something of his course.<br> <br>It is unclear whether, in later life, Hernando could reach back beyond this earliest recorded memory to the rather different circumstances in which, earlier that year, his father had returned from his first voyage across the Atlantic. Columbus had arrived back in Europe with only one of the three vessels with which he had left Spain on 3 August 1492: his flagship, Santa Maria, had run aground off Hispaniola on Christmas Eve, and on the return voyage he had lost sight of the Pinta during a storm near the Azores. Thirty-nine of Columbus&#x2019;s original crew of ninety or so had been left on the other side of the ocean, in the newly founded settlement of La Navidad in Hispaniola, a town built from the shipwrecked lumber of the Santa Maria with the assistance of the local king or cacique, Guacanagar�, and named in honor of the Christmas Day on which it was founded. Columbus&#x2019;s skeleton crew for the return voyage had been reduced to just three men when the rest were taken prisoner by unfriendly islanders in the Azores, though he did eventually secure their release. And when the great explorer finally did reach Europe in the only ship remaining to him, the Ni�a, he was running under bare poles after another heavy storm had split the sails. To make matters worse, he had arrived back not in Spain but in Portugal, dragging his ship past the Rock of Sintra to take shelter under the Castle of Almada in Lisbon estuary, where he was treated with suspicion before eventually receiving a summons to make his report to King Jo�o. Though later reports would focus on the crowds who covered the harbor in their skiffs, swarming to see the island natives whom Columbus had brought home as part of his plunder, Columbus&#x2019;s royal audience was for all intents and purposes an imprisonment, and his release was in part prompted by Jo�o&#x2019;s doubts regarding the discoverer&#x2019;s claims. Hernando&#x2019;s written records of these early events would record the hardship but leave out much of the confusion of this first return, of the forlorn man and his outlandish claims.2<br> <br> <br>A contemporary drawing (1509) of the harbor of Cadiz, site of Hernando&#x2019;s earliest recorded memory.<br><br>Hernando&#x2019;s early life was unusual&#x2014;perhaps unprecedented&#x2014;because from the youngest age his personal recollections of his father would have contended with widely circulated written accounts of Columbus&#x2019;s exploits. Hernando may have been present at C�rdoba in March when a letter was read aloud at the cathedral announcing his father&#x2019;s discoveries, and he kept as central relics in his library several editions of the letter, printed first at Barcelona, through which the discoveries were announced to the world. Hernando&#x2019;s later collecting was to place at the heart of his universal library precisely this kind of cheap print whose first rustlings could be heard in these reports on Columbus&#x2019;s voyage. The letter that was to be the common reading matter of Europe was written by Columbus when he landed in Portugal, and the crowds of Jews embarking from Lisbon harbor for Fez in North Africa would have served as a reminder that his ocean crossing would be forced to compete for public attention. The tumultuous course of recent events had reached a peak of intensity in the early months of 1492, when with the taking of Granada Ferdinand and Isabella finally completed the Reconquista, the capture of the Spanish peninsula from the Muslims who had ruled it (almost whole or in parts) for seven hundred years, a crusade that was cast as the righteous restoration of Christian rule. In an attempt to transform the small symbolic victory at Granada into a turning point in the ancient clash between the Abrahamic faiths, the Reyes Cat�licos celebrated their military triumph by presenting the Jews in their dominions with an ultimatum: forced conversion or exile. This was only an escalation of a long-standing Spanish history of persecuting those of the Jewish faith, but it proved a decisive one. Despite the fact that the Jewish community had been established in Iberia even longer than the Muslims and had been central to the flourishing of culture and society in Arabic Spain, many of them could not stomach the price of keeping their homes, which included agreeing that their sacred Talmud was merely a forgery designed to stop the onward march of the Christian faith. Those who chose to stay also faced the prospect of having their property confiscated by the likes of Tom�s de Torquemada, the leader of the Inquisition, set up in 1478, who would use this fortune to finance a golden age of Spanish art and exploration. A great multitude prepared to leave, and in their number went many of the greatest intellectuals of fifteenth-century Spain. Forced, as one chronicler records, to sell their houses for a donkey and their vineyards for a little bread, they made the most of the disaster by casting it as a new Exodus, in which the Lord of Hosts would lead them in triumph to the Promised Land. Observing this pathetic scene did not restrain the same chronicler from accusing them of secretly taking much of the kingdom&#x2019;s gold with them. The rabbis attempted to alleviate any feeling of desperation by having the women and children sing to the sounds of timbrels as they walked away from their homes. Though the Jews were given temporary asylum in Portugal, their safe haven there lasted only as long as Columbus&#x2019;s first voyage, and when their paths crossed in Lisbon, the Jews were on the move again, boarding ships bound for North Africa.3<br> <br>Even in his travel-worn state Columbus was quick to find a way for his own expedition to play a part in this grand historic narrative. His voyage west had, after all, been given royal sanction from the camp at Santa Fe outside the walls of Granada, at which Ferdinand and Isabella were celebrating the recent capitulation of the city&#x2019;s last Muslim king, Boabdil, and from which they would also later issue the edict expelling the Jews. The letter Columbus sent ahead to Barcelona from Portugal sang of the marvelous fertility of the islands he had found, in perpetual bloom, and the naked innocence of the native people, who were willing to part with the abundant gold of that region for a few trifles from the visitors they regarded as descended from heaven. If the Jews had a new Exodus, Columbus offered Christians a new Eden. The letter announced that even if the natives knew nothing of Castile or of Christ, they showed themselves miraculously ready to serve both. As a token of their part in an expanded Spanish empire, Columbus had renamed these islands as he took possession of them, so that they now reflected the hierarchy of Spanish power, from Christ the Savior on down through the Monarchs and royal children:<br> <br>San Salvador<br> <br>Santa Maria de la Concepci�n<br> <br>Fernandina<br> <br>Isabela<br> <br>Juana<br> <br>Hispaniola<br> <br>In its final paragraph the letter makes clear what has been implicit in the preceding pages, namely that these islands Columbus had encountered should be added to the list of famous victories achieved by the Catholic Monarchs, one that&#x2014;like the conquest of the Moorish kingdoms and the expulsion of the Jews&#x2014;would expand both the dominion of the Church and fill the coffers of Spain. This letter, soon printed again in Latin at Rome and Basel, and accompanied by a picture showing a single man guiding a ship toward an endless and fertile archipelago, was one of the central relics of Hernando&#x2019;s childhood, at once cheap and priceless, flimsy and timeless, manufactured and intimate, widely distributed and intensely personal.4<br> <br>Overwriting the native place names with Spanish ones was only one of the word tricks by which this New World was transformed, tricks that included set speeches through which Columbus and others legally &#x201c;took possession&#x201d; of the islands, even though these speeches meant nothing to the indigenous peoples listening to them. The former names began to lose their authority and were often soon lost altogether, as Spanish power came to seem natural in a place with so many Spanish names. For all the momentous consequences of their actions, Columbus and his crew often seemed little conscious of the power of this act of naming. As Hernando was later to record, the last-named island, Hispaniola, was so called because they caught there the same fish available in Spain (gray mullet, bass, salmon, shad, dory, skate, corvinas, sardines, crayfish). The power of Columbus&#x2019;s names to change the world was often at odds with the casual way in which he chose them: to commemorate a particular event or an impression of the landscape, or, as here, because it brought back a memory of somewhere he had been before. One of the most powerful experiences for Columbus the explorer, and for the European audience of his feats, was the feeling of having found the familiar in an unexpected place, and around these familiar things the European imagination of the New World began to form.<br> <br> <br>An image from De insulis nuper in mari Indico repertis (Basel, 1494), showing Columbus manning a ship among the newly renamed islands.<br><br>Yet the letter that reached print and would later be found on the shelves of his son&#x2019;s library was not the first Columbus had written, and Hernando was later to record an original, lost letter penned during the storm off the Azores a few weeks before the return to Europe. Despairing of ever reaching Spain to make his report in person, Columbus in this letter lamented that he would leave his two sons without help in a strange land, far from his ancestors (who, as Spain would soon learn to forget, were Genoese). He had dipped a copy of this first letter in wax, sealing it inside a barrel and turning it overboard with a notice to the discoverer that they could exchange the contents for a reward of a thousand ducats at the Spanish court. It is the first of the documents key to Hernando&#x2019;s life that probably sits at the bottom of the sea.<br> <br>The letter Columbus wrote from Lisbon not only inaugurated his fame but also saved him from the fate of those who come second. Arriving back in the Spanish port of Palos on 15 March, he learned that in fact the Pinta had not sunk in the storm off the Azores, and that its captain, Mart�n Alonso Pinz�n, had himself gone ahead to Barcelona to break the news of the discovery and conquest to Ferdinand and Isabella. Crucially, Columbus&#x2019;s luck held out a few days longer, and Pinz�n died before he could gain an audience with the Monarchs. The explorer arrived in Barcelona in mid-April, bringing with him eyewitness reports and gifts from the lands (in the words of one contemporary report) &#x201c;where the sun sets in the month of March&#x201d;: pineapples, cotton, parrots, cinnamon, canoes, peppers four times as hot as those eaten in Spain, a group of natives, and (most important) a small amount of gold. The intended effect of this list&#x2014;the argument it makes without seeming to&#x2014;is simple: In a land of such varied and unrelated wonders, who can doubt that anything could be true? In this, Columbus&#x2019;s gifts were like the great medieval collection of Jean, duc de Berry, which among its three thousand items contained a unicorn&#x2019;s horn, St. Joseph&#x2019;s engagement ring, an embalmed elephant, an egg found inside another egg, and other such marvels. The force of this argument, of these incomprehensible novelties, seems to have been enough to gain widespread acceptance for Columbus&#x2019;s claims that gold was marvelously abundant in those regions, even if he had only a meager sample at present. He knelt before Ferdinand and Isabella, who quickly raised him to his feet and recognized him as the Admiral of the Ocean Sea, going on to reconfirm the rewards that had been promised at Santa Fe in January 1492, which conferred upon him in the event of a successful voyage extraordinary rights over lands he claimed in the Monarchs&#x2019; names.5<br> <br>In a remarkable display of Columbus&#x2019;s new status, he then rode on horseback through Barcelona in triumph, flanking Ferdinand with his heir, the Infante Juan. If, as is likely, Columbus rode on Ferdinand&#x2019;s left side, he would have seen the still-tender scar running from the king&#x2019;s ear down to his shoulder, the result of an attempted assassination a few months earlier. The wide variety of groups suspected of being behind this attack&#x2014;the French, the Catalans, the Navarrese, the Castilians&#x2014;was a reminder of the fragile state of Ferdinand and Isabella&#x2019;s Spanish union, which faced opposition from within the Iberian Peninsula and outside it. Isabella had wrested her kingdom not only from the Moors but before that from her half brother, Enrique IV, and those loyal to his line, then forming with Ferdinand an unlikely but effective partnership to rule over their fractured and restive kingdoms; but the threat of a return to civil war was always present. That the blame for the assassination attempt was eventually pinned on a madman, one Juan de Ca�amares, who claimed the devil had incited him to kill the king, served, like Columbus&#x2019;s victorious return, conveniently to distract attention from local difficulties and to recast peninsular affairs as a battle between divine forces of Good and Evil.<br> <br>For now Hernando was probably sheltered by his youth from the fact that not everyone shared this triumphal account of his father&#x2019;s return. There wer...</p><h2>The Foundation of Mysticism: Spiritual Healing Principles of The Infinite Way</h2><p>Joel Goldsmith&#x2019;s class work in Hawaii in 1959 was devoted exclusively to reintroducing the healing principles of the Infinite Way, which are essential to establishing a foundation for mystical living. The Foundation of Mysticism provides edited transcripts of these important tape-recorded classes, which Goldsmith later referred to as the most significant material available to fully understand the principles and the practice of The Infinite Way.Speaking about spiritual healing, Goldsmith says, &#x201c;If you have an infinite, eternal, immortal God, and in the entire kingdom of God there is no evil, then, as scripture says, &#x2018;God is too pure to behold iniquity.&#x2019; Certainly God wouldn&#x2019;t tolerate it today and then heal you of it tomorrow. That would make of God a human being, and not even a very nice one. Oh, no! The reason healing is possible is this: God is, and God constitutes this universe, and God constitutes your being, which is perfect.&#x201d;New students will find this classic book to be a valuable and complete introduction to the principles of the Infinite Way, while experienced students will benefit greatly from the fresh clarity with which Joel teaches the principles anew.</p><p>JOEL S. GOLDSMITH (1892-1964), a monumental teacher of practical mysticism, devoted most of his life to the discovery and teaching of spiritual principles which he founded and called The Infinite Way. After the publication of his seminal book, The Infinite Way, in 1947, Joel traveled throughout the world as a teacher and a healer. Although Goldsmith&#39;s message was neither organized nor advertised, students of The Infinite Way increased in numbers. Today, a worldwide student body exists which continues to practice and preserve his work. More than thirty books have been compiled from his tape-recorded lectures and classwork including &#34;The Infinite Way,&#34; &#34;Practicing the Presence&#34; and &#34;The Art of Meditation.&#34;<p>"A new generation of mature seekers, receptive to spiritual truth, is now discovering Joel Goldsmith's teachings, which have lost none of their relevance, aliveness and power. I foresee that those teachings will reach and impact even more people in the 21st century than during his lifetime.

Guido&#x2019;s family took a boat across the river and wheelbarrowed their provisions to their cabin. There were no roads on their side of the river, just miles of wilderness. The trails, mountains, canyons, draws, and creeks were part of their family mythology, a landscape both unknowable and intimate, like the river that flowed so full and strong even when they were not there, that changed every moment and changed not at all.<br><br>Here also, there were many ways to die. There were rattlesnakes coiled in the woodpile, scorpions sheltering under flat rocks, black widows spun into the corners of the boot room. None of them was as dangerous as the river itself; the river that had taken a beau of Guido&#x2019;s mother and a beloved cousin, swallowed them from sight, tugging them into the whirling currents and underwater vortices.<br><br>The other cabin belonged to our family. My father and Guido&#x2019;s mother were siblings, and in summers our families merged into one. There were five children in the Rahr family, and three in ours. Clustered around the same age, we were knit close in that rough country, playing games and making up stories that were too wild for most children.<br><br>Guido (pronounced Gee-doe) was the oldest of our pack of first cousins, and the only one who moved through our dangerous kingdom as if he belonged there. He had a natural grace and assurance and he rarely stepped wrong. As early as seven years old he would disappear for the day and rejoin us wordlessly, leaving us to wonder about the life he was leading, and how different it was from ours. He had been born with a natural intelligence that gave him a power we all recognized.<br><br>I tried to follow him. I was younger and a girl, but I was tough and I didn&#x2019;t complain. He tolerated me sometimes, but only if I moved through the landscape as he did, mimicking his silent walk, my senses alert. I stood by as he divined where a blue racer lay resting in the shade of a sagebrush, or when he lifted a rock that harbored a scorpion. He was no more afraid of a rattlesnake than a mouse, and his quick hands could catch anything.<br><br>He told me that even with his feet on the ground, he saw the earth from far above. I believed, in some shamanistic way, that he could. I believed that from his place in the sky, the stories of the land were apparent to him: those of rock formations, springs, volcanoes, and landslides. And within these large stories were smaller ones, each as complex and complete as a miniature solar system. He could make me see these things, and so was a kind of god to me.<br><br>I could not have guessed then how close we would one day be nor, indeed, that it was even possible to be close to such a boy.<br><br>I knew in a childlike way that Guido wasn&#x2019;t wired like most people. Nor was I. Since infancy, I had experienced brain tremors when for intense moments I trembled and shook and was unable to communicate. The episodes were both frightening and mysterious, for no doctor could explain why they happened. The tremors temporarily severed my connection to the world around me, and were terribly isolating. Guido was also isolated, but his was a strong isolation, and it was happy. Our slight maladaptations marked us as black sheep, the children the adults worried about most, the ones discussed in the hushed hours after dinner. But in those lonely, afflicted childhood years, Guido&#x2019;s contrariety was a gift to me. When I was with him, I lost track of time. His simple, focused world delivered me from the painful vicissitudes of my own. I didn&#x2019;t grasp then what an impossible child he was for his parents to raise&#x2014;or how hurtful he was to the family he more or less ignored. My aunt Laurie later told me how she and Guido Sr. had struggled with a son who had no interest in learning what they had to teach him, or indeed in what the wider world considered a conventional education.<br><br>What Guido wanted, from infancy, was the freedom to pursue his own learning, unimpeded by the many adults who oversaw his life. Another world beckoned to him, and the wilder the better. When his parents denied him access to it, he ran away. By the age of four, Guido had run away multiple times to roam the fields and streams around their home in Oregon; the local police became familiar with the boy who vanished into Lake Oswego&#x2019;s undeveloped swaths of suburbia, where he captured anything that moved and befriended it long enough to study it. Back in his room, he filled notebook upon notebook with renderings of insects, reptiles, and fish.<br><br>His mother was struck by the accuracy of his drawings. In preschool his precocity was noted by his teacher when she asked the class to draw what they thought their insides looked like. Most of the children drew circles filled with scribbles. Guido&#x2019;s drawing had intestines and bones and organs. His teacher was so astonished she called his parents to inform them that their four-year-old had a rudimentary understanding of human biology. Laurie was mystified. The only way Guido could have known such things was by studying the family World Book Encyclopedia, and what four-year-old did that?<br><br>His first-grade teacher, Helga Peters, told Laurie that she&#x2019;d never had a student like Guido; that in her experience most children were like sausages&#x2014;you could stuff them full of knowledge. But Guido wasn&#x2019;t like that; he knew exactly what he wanted to learn&#x2014;and it wasn&#x2019;t what she was teaching.<br><br>She wrote, <br><br>Guido has been the most original student during his first year in our primary grades. The academic tools, i.e. learning to read, learning to write and coping with mathematical concepts are to Guido an evil to be suffered. . . . He wants to read and write about the mysteries of nature, the creatures and the glorious wonders of creation. Although he can express himself magnificently in all art forms he is trying hard to read and to write, not easy when he has to match his excellent vocabulary. Since his speech is fast and slurred it is very hard for him to sound and spell words.<br><br>Up until this point, his parents had no idea anything was unusual about their firstborn other than that he was spirited and independent. &#x201c;We didn&#x2019;t know he was different,&#x201d; Laurie said. &#x201c;It was other people who told us he wasn&#x2019;t normal.&#x201d; As Guido grew older, the Rahrs began to struggle with their expectations of him. &#x201c;That he simply wouldn&#x2019;t cooperate came as a terrible shock to us,&#x201d; Laurie remembered. Guido Sr. was bewildered by his son&#x2019;s obstinacy and a character so unlike his own. The product of a genteel aristocratic German family, Guido Sr. was a pipe smoker and reader of poetry, and his love of nature ran to the romantic. He preferred fields of wildflowers to the high desert, the Alps to Oregon&#x2019;s rivers, a vintage rifle to a fishing rod. The rest of the Rahr children pleased Guido Sr. greatly; they were well behaved and seemed to understand the order of things. His firstborn continued to thwart his expectations.<br><br>One time the family set off for a posh tennis camp in Arizona to polish both their children&#x2019;s games and their etiquette. On their first day there, Guido failed to show up for a single tennis class. Somehow he managed to escape the compound and slink into the wilderness to see what lived in the bushes and under the rocks of the John Gardiner Tennis Ranch. He knew there were collared lizards and banded geckos. Of particular interest were the chuckwalla lizards, native to the region. These lizards did not live in Oregon, and Guido was eager to get his hands on one. When the family returned after their day of tennis, Guido was nowhere to be found. A scream issued from his mother in the bathroom when she found the bathtub filled with foot-long chuckwalla lizards.<br><br>&#x201c;We couldn&#x2019;t keep track of him,&#x201d; his mother said. &#x201c;He always had his own agenda&#x2014;and we were not party to it. It was only afterwards, when it was a fait accompli, that we learned what he was up to.&#x201d;<br><br>While he showed an aptitude for natural science, it was clear that something else was going on with Guido. He had an aversion to reading, and to any book that didn&#x2019;t involve pictures of reptiles. Unlike his educated and literary parents, he did not enjoy school, nor did he excel in classes other than art. Midway through elementary school, Guido was diagnosed with dyslexia. Special tutors were called in and he was forcibly held to the studies he loathed. When he was released, he disappeared, melting into the woods like a spirit. In fourth grade, Guido showed a glimmer of a deeper capacity. On a hunch, his mother gave him Raymond Ditmars&#x2019;s The Reptiles of North America. It was a thick, academic tome, filled with Latinate terms, scientific descriptions, and beautiful black-and-white plates and illustrations. &#x201c;His eyes grew big,&#x201d; she remembered. &#x201c;He sat down with it right away. I think it was the first book he had ever wanted to read.&#x201d; His parents watched as Guido bored into the pages of Ditmars&#x2019;s guide. &#x201c;It took him weeks to get through it, but he memorized it cover to cover.&#x201d; Laurie Rahr was fascinated by Guido&#x2019;s determination. It seemed that by sheer will, her nine-year-old son overcame his dyslexia.</p><h2>Why I Am Not a Calvinist</h2><p>What's wrong with Calvinism? Since the Reformation, Calvinism has dominated much of evangelical thought. It has been so well established that many Christians simply assume it to be the truest expression of Christian doctrine. But Calvinism has some serious biblical and theological weaknesses that unsettle laypeople, pastors and scholars alike. God is sovereign. All evangelical Christians--whether Arminians or Calvinists--have no doubt about this fundamental truth. But how does God express his sovereignty? Is God a master puppeteer, pulling our strings? Or has he graciously given his children freedom to respond to his love? In this eminently readable book, Jerry L. Walls and Joseph R. Dongell explore the flaws of Calvinist theology. <em>Why I Am Not a Calvinist</em> is a must-read for all who struggle with the limitations of this dominant perspective within evangelical theology.</p><p>Jerry L. Walls is professor of philosophy of religion at Asbury Theological Seminary in Wilmore, Kentucky. His annual C. S. Lewis seminar is one of the school's most popular offerings. He is also author of <em>Hell: The Logic of Damnation.</em>"An honest and polite articulation of why these two thinkers are not Calvinists. Useful reading and thought provoking." (Myk Habets, Pacific Journal of Baptist Research)<br><br>"Without the usual rancor, hysteria and triumphalism, Walls and Dongell offer a clear and forceful biblical and philosophical case for Arminianism. This book is a welcome and important contribution to the recent upsurge in discussions of Calvinism and Arminianism." (Kelly James Clark, Professor of Philosophy, Calvin College)<br><br>"The biblical, theological and rational case against Calvinism has never been stated more clearly, concisely, irenically or convincingly." (Roger E. Olson, Professor of Theology, George W. Truett Theological Seminary, Baylor University)<br><br>"Walls and Dongell present an exceptional blend of careful scholarship, readable presentation, uncompromising conviction, and graceful opposition in their forcefully argued book <em>Why I Am Not a Calvinist.</em> Points that make this a book well worth buying and reading include the following: The book demonstrates well the often overlooked fact that the issues between Calvinism and Arminianism are not primarily exegetical but theological and even philosophical. This task is ably accomplished by the combination of an exegetical scholar and a theological philosopher in the authorial team--an ideal amalgamation for such a book. The book clearly identifies and explains the most powerful problems for Calvinism--conceptual problems with the notion of freedom, logical consistency problems and problems of ingenuous application of Calvinist theology to Christian life. While clearly and unapologetically <em>non</em>-Calvinist, the authors are most assuredly not anti-Calvinist. Their treatment of Calvinism and Calvinists is always in the spirit of Christian love, acceptance, understanding and unity. The book is very timely, given the central debates in contemporary conservative and evangelical theology and the resurgence of pro-Calvinist sentiment over the last two decades." (Dr. James F. Sennett, Professor of Philosophy and Interdisciplinary Studies, Lincoln Christian College and Seminary)</p><h2>Conversation in the Cathedral</h2><p><p><strong>A Haunting tale of power, corruption,<br>and the complex search for identity</strong></p> <p><strong>Conversation in The Cathedral</strong> takes place in 1950s Peru during the dictatorship of Manuel A.

Born in Marseille to a family of relatively modest means, Manchette grew up in a southwestern suburb of Paris, where he wrote from an early age. While a student of English literature at the Sorbonne, he contributed articles to the newspaper <i>La Voie communiste</i> and became active in the national students&#x2019; union. In 1961 he married, and with his wife M�lissa began translating American crime fiction&#x2014;he would go on to translate the works of such writers as Donald Westlake, Ross Thomas, and Margaret Millar, often for Gallimard&#x2019;s S�rie noire. Throughout the 1960s Manchette supported himself with various jobs writing television scripts, screenplays, young-adult books, and film novelizations. In 1971 he published his first novel, a collaboration with Jean-Pierre Bastid, and embarked on his literary career in earnest, producing ten subsequent works over the course of the next two decades and establishing a new genre of French novel, the <i>n�o-polar</i> (distinguished from traditional detective novel, or <i>polar</i>, by its political engagement and social radicalism). During the 1980s, Manchette published celebrated translations of Alan Moore&#x2019;s Watchmen graphic novels for a <i>bande-dessin�e </i>publishing house co-founded by his son, Doug Headline. In addition to <i>Fatale</i> (also available as an NYRB Classic), Manchette&#x2019;s novels <i>Three to Kill</i> and <i>The Prone Gunman</i>, as well as Jacques Tardi&#x2019;s graphic-novel adaptations of them (titled <i>West Coast Blues</i> and <i>Like a Sniper Lining Up His Shot</i>, respectively), are available in English.<br><br><b>Donald Nicholson-Smith</b>&#x2019;s translations of noir fiction include Manchette&#x2019;s <i>Three to Kill</i>; Thierry Jonquet&#x2019;s<i> Mygale</i> (a.k.a. <i>Tarantula</i>); and (with Alyson Waters) Yasmina Khadra&#x2019;s <i>Cousin K</i>. He has also translated works by Paco Ignacio Taibo II, Henri Lefebvre, Raoul Vaneigem, Antonin Artaud, Jean Laplanche, Guillaume Apollinaire, and Guy Debord. For NYRB Classics he has translated Manchette&#x2019;s <i>Fatale </i>and is presently working on Jean-Paul Cl�bert&#x2019;s <i>Paris Insolite</i>. Born in Manchester, England, he is a longtime resident of New York City.<br><br><b>James Sallis</b>&#x2019;s recent and forthcoming books include the novel <i>Others of My Kind</i>, a reissue of his novel <i>Death Will Have Your Eyes</i>, and <i>Black Night&#x2019;s Gonna Catch Me Here: Selected Poems 1968-2012</i>. He is also the author of <i>Drive</i> and of <i>Chester Himes: A Life</i>, and the translator of Raymond Queneau&#x2019;s novel <i>Saint Glinglin</i>."[Manchette's] writing is lean and relentless, a brutal evocation of a world in which conventional morality is just another lie we tell ourselves...<i>The Mad and the Bad</i>&nbsp;is so dark it redefines noir: bleak and pointed, yes, but also infused with an understanding that what passes between us is not only compromised but more often faithless, less a matter of commitment or connection than a kind of unrelenting animal need." &#x2014;David L.

Visit Lynn&#39;s Web site at www.lynnaustin.orgChristy award-winning historical novelist Austin delivers her strongest offering yet, a coming-of-age story set in late-19th-century Illinois. The great strength of this novel comes from the first-person narrator's charming voice: 20-year-old Violet Hayes is distressed to learn that her father is remarrying-and that her mother, whom Violet believed lay recovering from a mysterious illness in a sanitarium somewhere, had in fact simply abandoned her family and filed for divorce. To escape a stepmother-to-be she can't stand, Violet heads to Chicago to stay with her grandmother and great-aunts. Although she's recently graduated from a genteel school for young ladies, it's in Chicago that Violet's real education begins. One great-aunt tries to persuade her to join the suffrage movement, while another introduces Violet to elite society and urges her to catch a wealthy husband. Her grandmother, who takes her cues from Jane Addams, introduces Violet to the world of revivalist Christianity and inner-city good works, prompting Violet to re-examine her own faith. Two questions drive the plot: will Violet find her mother, and will she encounter true love? Readers will enjoy accompanying Violet as she discovers the answers, her calling and her adult self. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

From Horace to Soyinka, Corneille to Brecht, this is an indispensable compendium of the greatest dramatic theory ever written.</p><p>Daniel Gerould is the Lucille Lortel Distinguished Professor of Theatre and Comparative Literature at the City University of New York. He is the author of <i>Guillotine: Its Legend and Lore</i>, as well as the editor of <i>Slavic and East European Performances</i> and the <i>Polish and Eastern European Theatre Archives</i> for Harwood.There are many collections of literary theory, including several good ones on ancient and modern drama. This anthology stands out in the field because it attempts to be culturally inclusive rather than strictly Western European in its content. A healthy introduction and good header essays frame classical Indian commentary on Sanskrit drama, a Japanese piece on No- plays, and a selection from Wole Soyinka's essay on African theater, as well as recent theoretical writings from Augusto Boal and Vaclav Havel from the West. Most of the rest of the selections are familiar. There are a few surprises, such as Adam Mickiewicz on Slavic drama and F.T. Marinetti on the Variety Theatre. One quibbles: Several of the translations are old, dating from anywhere between 1687 and 1920; there must be more recent renderings in the public domain. Though the book's inclusiveness is to be commended, all but four selections are from the Western tradition, so, ultimately, its cultural breadth is limited.

Between 1917 and 1922, Russia underwent a complete and irreversible transformation. Taking advantage of the collapse of the Tsarist regime in the middle of World War I, the Bolsheviks staged a hostile takeover of the Russian Imperial Army, promoting mutinies and mass desertions of men in order to fulfill Lenin's program of turning the "imperialist war" into civil war. By the time the Bolsheviks had snuffed out the last resistance five years later, over 20 million people had died, and the Russian economy had collapsed so completely that Communism had to be temporarily abandoned. Still, Bolshevik rule was secure, owing to the new regime's monopoly on force, enabled by illicit arms deals signed with capitalist neighbors such as Germany and Sweden who sought to benefit-politically and economically-from the revolutionary chaos in Russia.<br><br> Drawing on scores of previously untapped files from Russian archives and a range of other repositories in Europe, Turkey, and the United States, McMeekin delivers exciting, groundbreaking research about this turbulent era. The first comprehensive history of these momentous events in two decades, <i>The Russian Revolution </i>combines cutting-edge scholarship and a fast-paced narrative to shed new light on one of the most significant turning points of the twentieth century.<br><br></p><p><b>Sean McMeekin</b> is a professor of history at Bard College.

Sean McMeekin is a gifted writer with historical talents equal to the challenge of helping the reader to follow the events of the revolution and appreciate their terrible significance... And in a world menaced by new totalitarians, by political actors prepared to use conflict as a path to power, by states ready to use their money to suborn democracy elsewhere and by liberals often paralysed by in-fighting rather than united by principle, McMeekin's magisterial study repays careful reading."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Times</i> (UK)</b></i></b><br><br>"It is a quarter of a century since Richard Pipes published his history of the Bolshevik seizure of power in the Russian empire, and twenty years since Orlando Figes's A People's Tragedy. Back then, in the wake of the Soviet collapse, those seemed definitive. But now comes Sean McMeekin with a vivid new account, drawing on fresh evidence and offering an original, geopolitical perspective. The full, shocking extent to which Lenin was a German operative now becomes clear, as does the magnitude of Kerensky's blunder in not finishing the Bolsheviks off before their "revolutionary defeatism" went viral. McMeekin writes muscular history. His <i>Russian Revolution</i> grips the reader." <br>&#x2015;<b><i><b>Niall Ferguson, senior fellow, the Hoover Institution, Stanford</b></i></b><br><br>"Sean McMeekin's new history of the Russian Revolution is, as always with his work, dynamic, compelling, and revisionist, telling the familiar story with vigour, accessibility, and elan but ornamented with fascinating new archival revelations on, amongst other things, German funding of the Bolsheviks." <br>&#x2015;<b><i><b>Simon Sebag Montefiore, author of <i>The Romanovs</i></b></i></b><br><br>"The Tsar didn't fall, he wilted, and this briskly written, fresh take on the revolution sketches the process in poignant detail-orgies, vodka, Rasputin, pogroms, plots, and war on the Eastern Front. McMeekin's Lenin is more seedy than heroic, his Bolshevik victory an act of treason engineered by a German army that had stuffed a billion dollars in Lenin's pockets before the bourgeois exile mounted his first barricade in Petrograd." <br>&#x2015;<b><i><b>Geoffrey Wawro, author of <i>A Mad Catastrophe</i></b></i></b><br><br>"This is a book that we have been waiting for. The Russian Revolution is an enormous subject, and to write a short and authoritative book on it is very difficult indeed.

But even though Amanda Yates Garcia's mother, a practicing witch herself, initiated her into the earth-centered practice of witchcraft when she was 13 years old, Amanda's real life as a witch only began when she underwent a series of spontaneous initiations of her own.<br><br>Descending into the underworlds of poverty, sex work, and misogyny, <i>Initiated</i> describes Amanda's journey to return to her body, harness her power, and create the magical world she longed for through witchcraft. Hailed by crows, seduced by magicians, and haunted by ancestors broken beneath the wheels of patriarchy, Amanda's quest for self-discovery and empowerment is a deep exploration of a modern witch's trials - healing ancient wounds, chafing against cultural expectations, creating intimacy - all while on a mission to re-enchant the world. Peppered with mythology, tales of the goddesses and magical women throughout history, <i>Initiated</i> stands squarely at the intersection of witchcraft and feminism. With generosity and heart, this book speaks to the question: is it possible to live a life of beauty and integrity in a world that feels like it's dying?<br><br>Declaring oneself a witch and practicing magic has everything to do with claiming authority and power for oneself, of taking back our planet in the name of Love. <i>Initiated</i> is both memoir and manifesto calling the magical people of the world to take up their wands: stand up, be brave, describe the world they want, then create it like a witch.<br></p><p>Amanda Yates Garcia is a writer, artist, professional witch, and the Oracle of Los Angeles. Her work has been featured in The Millions, <i>The LA Times, Time Out, LA Weekly</i>, GOOP, <i>Glamour, The London Times</i>, CNN, Salon, as well as a viral appearance on Tucker Carlson Tonight. She has led classes and workshops on magic and witchcraft at UCLA, UC Irvine, MOCA Los Angeles, The Hammer Museum, LACMA, The Getty and many other venues. Co-host of the popular Strange Magic podcast, Initiated is her first book."Mythic journeys to the underworld, goddesses, ecstasies, fairy tales, ghosts, love, sex, female empowerment, challenging the patriarchy: <i>Initiated</i> is full of my favorite things, told with savage grace by my favorite oracle, the powerful and devastatingly enchanting Amanda Yates Garcia. This book will change your life."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Francesca Lia Block</b></i></b><br><br><i>"Initiated</i> is breathtaking--gorgeously written, fierce, political, personal, and deeply inspiring. I love this book."<br>&#x2015;<b><i><b>Michelle Tea, author of <i>Modern Tarot</i></b></i></b><br><br> "Yates Garcia takes us on a sweeping, expansive, generous, and beautifully intuitive journey into feminine power in Initiated. She leads us fearlessly into the dark underworld of patriarchal oppression, intergenerational trauma, loss and grief, where, she says, every witch must go to find her magic. This book is a powerful political protest and a call to return to first principles as a nation, a society, and a people. Come to it seeking your own artistic and intellectual path, and leave trusting yourself, trusting others, and trusting in the unconditional love you will find in the collective soul of the world."<br> &#x2015;<b><i> <b>Sarah Gerard, author of <i>Binary Star</i></b><br> </i></b><br><br>"A journey through wild beauty and deep wounds, <i>Initiated</i> is the book we need right now-it is an embrace, an awakening, a forging by flame and an enchanted rallying cry."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Jade Chang, author of <i>The Wangs vs. the World</i></b></i></b><br><br>"To read <i>Initiated </i>is to undergo your own. Amanda's wisdom and insight into the heart of the witch is complimented by her ability to weave together a story that is also a spell. Somewhere between a memoir and a grimoire, this book invites the reader to reflect on their own cycles of life and death as well as their own relationship to the witch. All in a way that's uplifting, engaging, feminist as fuck and so unapologetically fierce. No one else could have written this story, and whether you identify as a witch or not, you'll leave obsessed."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Gabriela Herstik, author of <i>Inner Witch: A Modern Guide to the Ancient Craft</i></b></i></b><br><br> "Early on in her beautifully written memoir, Amanda Yates Garcia says of her sister, 'I decided to love her forever.' That is precisely how I felt about this gorgeous memoir that refuses to be labeled or to fit inside any kind of box. Part history, part mythology, part poetry, part prose; but mostly: magic. Which is to say: this is a book about love. A book which challenges the reader to a deeper understanding of what it means to be human in a complicated and beautiful world. My copy is dog eared and highlighted and I plan to pass it on to all my friends. This book reminds us that we all are powerful with the capacity to change the world, one witch at a time."&#x2015;<b><i> <b> Jennifer Pastiloff, author of <i>On Being Human</i></b><br> </i></b><br><br> "This bold and transporting story of one woman's awakening into her own spiritual power reads as a metaphysical coming of age, bearing gifts for anyone seeking her own alignment in the world."<br> &#x2015;<b><i> <b>Amelia Gray, author of <i>Isadora</i></b><br> </i></b><br><br> "Amanda Yates Garcia's <i>Initiated</i> is the ideal coming-into-witchhood story for our troubled times. It functions not only as a scathing personal critique of patriarchy and oppression, but as a manual for dismantling them from the ground up, told with style, deep spiritual insight, and brutal honesty. Raw, lyrically enchanting, and brimming with feminine power, this is the book of shadows and light our imperiled world desperately needs right now."<br> &#x2015;<b><i> <b> Michael M. Hughes, author of <i>Magic for the Resistance: Rituals and Spells for Change</i></b><br> </i></b><br><br> "In a world desperately in need of re-enchantment, Initiated provides more than its fair share. It is a battle cry, a blueprint, and most of all, a love letter to the traditions of witchcraft, the benefits of co-creation and interdependence, and our innate ability to manifest our collective power as women and humans."<br> &#x2015;<b><i> <b>Leah Dieterich, author of <i>The Vanishing Twins</i></b><br> </i></b><br><br> "As much as witches are warriors, we are also guardians-of a history, culture, and practice that's been erased and persecuted for millennia. Recently, I've watched with apprehension as witchcraft, in a much-needed renaissance, has also become a lifestyle trend on Instagram, ahistorical and commodified. I've been hoping for a visibility that cannot divorce witchcraft from its insurrectionary origins, its lineage of liberation, its blood memory that connects us to its feminist fire. As <i>Initiated </i>luminously testifies, Amanda Yates Garcia is the kind of warrior <i>and </i>guardian witches need: subversive and scholarly, empowered and devoted, a magician and a firebrand."<br>&#x2015;<b><i> <b>Johanna Hedva, author of <i>On Hell</i></b><br> </i></b></p><h2>Zoo Station (A John Russell WWII Spy Thriller)</h2><p>By 1939, Anglo-American journalist John Russell has spent over a decade in Berlin, where his son lives with his mother.

In Danzig it had been<br>snowing on and off all day, and a gang of children was enjoying a snowball<br>fight in front of the grain warehouses which lined the old waterfront.<br>John Russell paused to watch them for a few moments, then<br>walked on up the cobbled street toward the blue and yellow lights.<br><br>The Sweden Bar was far from crowded, and those few faces that<br>turned his way weren&#x2019;t exactly brimming over with festive spirit. In fact,<br>most of them looked like they&#x2019;d rather be somewhere else.<br><br>It was an easy thing to want. The Christmas decorations hadn&#x2019;t<br>been removed, just allowed to drop, and they now formed part of the<br>flooring, along with patches of melting slush, floating cigarette butts,<br>and the odd broken bottle. The bar was famous for the savagery of its<br>international brawls, but on this particular night the various groups of<br>Swedes, Finns, and Letts seemed devoid of the energy needed to get<br>one started. Usually a table or two of German naval ratings could be<br>relied upon to provide the necessary spark, but the only Germans<br>present were a couple of aging prostitutes, and they were getting<br>ready to leave.<br><br>Russell took a stool at the bar, bought himself a Goldwasser, and<br>glanced through the month-old copy of the New York Herald Tribune<br>which, for some inexplicable reason, was lying there. One of his own<br>articles was in it, a piece on German attitudes to their pets. It was<br>accompanied by a cute-looking photograph of a Schnauzer.<br><br>Seeing him reading, a solitary Swede two stools down asked him, in<br>perfect English, if he spoke that language. Russell admitted that he did.<br><br>&#x201c;You are English!&#x201d; the Swede exclaimed, and shifted his considerable<br>bulk to the stool adjoining Russell&#x2019;s.<br><br>Their conversation went from friendly to sentimental, and sentimental<br>to maudlin, at what seemed like a breakneck pace. Three<br>Goldwassers later, the Swede was telling him that he, Lars, was not the<br>true father of his children. Vibeke had never admitted it, but he knew<br>it to be true.<br><br>Russell gave him an encouraging pat on the shoulder, and Lars<br>sunk forward, his head making a dull clunk as it hit the polished surface<br>of the bar. &#x201c;Happy New Year,&#x201d; Russell murmured. He shifted the<br>Swede&#x2019;s head slightly to ease the man&#x2019;s breathing, and got up to leave.<br><br>Outside, the sky was beginning to clear, the air almost cold enough<br>to sober him up. An organ was playing in the Protestant Seamen&#x2019;s<br>Church, nothing hymnal, just a slow lament, as if the organist were saying<br>a personal farewell to the year gone by. It was a quarter to midnight.<br><br>Russell walked back across the city, conscious of the moisture seeping<br>in through the holes in his shoes. There were lots of couples on<br>Langer Markt, laughing and squealing as they clutched each other for<br>balance on the slippery sidewalks.<br><br>He cut over to Breite Gasse and reached the Holz-Markt just as the<br>bells began pealing in the New Year. The square was full of celebrating<br>people, and an insistent hand pulled him into a circle of revelers<br>dancing and singing in the snow. When the song ended and the circle<br>broke up, the Polish girl on his left reached up and brushed her lips<br>against his, eyes shining with happiness. It was, he thought, a betterthan-<br>expected opening to 1939.<br>HIS HOTEL'S RECEPTION AREA was deserted, and the sounds of<br>celebration emanating from the kitchen at the back suggested the<br>night staff were enjoying their own private party. Russell gave up the<br>idea of making himself a hot chocolate while his shoes dried in one of<br>the ovens, and took his key. He clambered up the stairs to the third floor,<br>and trundled down the corridor to his room. Closing the door behind<br>him, he became painfully aware that the occupants of the neighboring<br>rooms were still welcoming in the new year, loud singing on one side,<br>floor-shaking sex on the other. He took off his shoes and socks, dried his<br>wet feet with a towel, and sank back onto the vibrating bed.<br><br>There was a discreet, barely audible tap on his door.<br><br>Cursing, he levered himself off the bed and pulled the door open.<br>A man in a crumpled suit and open shirt stared back at him.<br><br>&#x201c;Mr. John Russell,&#x201d; the man said in English, as if he were introducing<br>Russell to himself.

The man&#x2019;s face was vaguely familiar.<br>&#x201c;But why not?&#x201d; he continued, as the singers next door reached for<br>a new and louder chorus. &#x201c;A journalist should never turn down a conversation,&#x201d;<br>he murmured, mostly to himself, as he let the man in.<br>&#x201c;Take the chair,&#x201d; he suggested.<br><br>His visitor sat back and crossed one leg over the other, hitching up his<br>trouser as he did so. &#x201c;We have met before,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;A long time ago.<br>My name is Shchepkin.

Shchepkin&#x2019;s hair had been black and wavy in 1924; now it was<br>a close-cropped gray. They were both a little older than the century,<br>Russell guessed, and Shchepkin was wearing pretty well, considering<br>what he&#x2019;d probably been through the last fifteen years.

We want a series of articles about positive aspects of the Nazi<br>regime.&#x201d; He paused for a few seconds, waiting in vain for Russell to<br>demand an explanation. &#x201c;You are not German but you live in Berlin,&#x201d;<br>Shchepkin went on. &#x201c;You once had a reputation as a journalist of the<br>left, and though that reputation has&#x2014;shall we say&#x2014;faded, no one<br>could accuse you of being an apologist for the Nazis . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But you want me to be just that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, no. We want positive aspects, not a positive picture overall.<br>That would not be believable.&#x201d;<br><br>Russell was curious in spite of himself. Or because of the Goldwassers.<br>&#x201c;Do you just need my name on these articles?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;Or<br>do you want me to write them as well?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, we want you to write them. We like your style&#x2014;all that irony.&#x201d;<br>Russell shook his head: Stalin and irony didn&#x2019;t seem like much of a<br>match.<br><br>Shchepkin misread the gesture. &#x201c;Look,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;let me put all my<br>cards on the table.&#x201d;<br><br>Russell grinned.<br><br>Shchepkin offered a wry smile in return. &#x201c;Well, most of them anyway.<br>Look, we are aware of your situation. You have a German son and<br>a German lady-friend, and you want to stay in Germany if you possibly<br>can. Of course if a war breaks out you will have to leave, or else they<br>will intern you. But until that moment comes&#x2014;and maybe it won&#x2019;t&#x2014;<br>miracles do happen&#x2014;until it does you want to earn your living as a<br>journalist without upsetting your hosts. What better way than this? You<br>write nice things about the Nazis&#x2014;not too nice, of course; it has to be<br>credible&#x2014;but you stress their good side.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Does shit have a good side?&#x201d; Russell wondered out loud.<br><br>&#x201c;Come, come,&#x201d; Shchepkin insisted, &#x201c;you know better than that.<br>Unemployment eliminated, a renewed sense of community, healthy<br>children, cruises for workers, cars for the people. . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You should work for Joe Goebbels.&#x201d;<br><br>Shchepkin gave him a mock-reproachful look.<br><br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Russell said, &#x201c;I take your point. Let me ask you a question.<br>There&#x2019;s only one reason you&#x2019;d want that sort of article: You&#x2019;re softening<br>up your own people for some sort of deal with the devil. Right?&#x201d;<br><br>Shchepkin flexed his shoulders in an eloquent shrug.<br><br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br><br>The Russian grunted. &#x201c;Why deal with the devil? I don&#x2019;t know what<br>the leadership is thinking. But I could make an educated guess and so<br>could you.&#x201d;<br><br>Russell could. &#x201c;The western powers are trying to push Hitler east,<br>so Stalin has to push him west? Are we talking about a non-aggression<br>pact, or something more?&#x201d;<br><br>Shchepkin looked almost affronted. &#x201c;What more could there be?<br>Any deal with that man can only be temporary. We know what he is.&#x201d;<br><br>Russell nodded. It made sense. He closed his eyes, as if it were possible<br>to blank out the approaching calamity. On the other side of the<br>opposite wall, his musical neighbors were intoning one of those Polish<br>river songs which could reduce a statue to tears. Through the wall behind<br>him silence had fallen, but his bed was still quivering like a tuning fork.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;d also like some information,&#x201d; Shchepkin was saying, almost<br>apologetically. &#x201c;Nothing military,&#x201d; he added quickly, seeing the look on<br>Russell&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;No armament statistics or those naval plans that Sherlock<br>Holmes is always being asked to recover. Nothing of that sort. We<br>just want a better idea of what ordinary Germans are thinking. How<br>they are taking the changes in working conditions, how they are likely<br>to react if war comes&#x2014;that sort of thing. We don&#x2019;t want any secrets,<br>just your opinions. And nothing on paper. You can deliver them in person,<br>on a monthly basis.&#x201d;<br><br>Russell looked skeptical.<br><br>Shchepkin ploughed on. &#x201c;You will be well paid&#x2014;very well. In any<br>currency, any bank, any country, that you choose. You can move into a<br>better apartment block. . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I like my apartment block.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You can buy things for your son, your girlfriend. You can have<br>your shoes mended.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t. . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The money is only an extra. You were with us once. . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A long long time ago.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, I know. But you cared about your fellow human beings. I<br>heard you talk. That doesn&#x2019;t change. And if we go under there will be<br>nothing left.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A cynic might say there&#x2019;s not much to choose between you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The cynic would be wrong,&#x201d; Shchepkin replied, exasperated and<br>perhaps a little angry. &#x201c;We have spilled blood, yes. But reluctantly, and<br>in hope of a better future. They enjoy it. Their idea of progress is a<br>European slave-state.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;One more thing. If money and politics don&#x2019;t persuade you, think of<br>this. We will be grateful, and we have influence almost everywhere.<br>And a man like you, in a situation like yours, is going to need influential<br>friends.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No doubt about that.&#x201d;<br><br>Shchepkin was on his feet. &#x201c;Think about it, Mr. Russell,&#x201d; he said,<br>drawing an envelope from the inside pocket of his jacket and placing<br>it on the nightstand. &#x201c;All the details are in here&#x2014;how many words,<br>delivery dates, fees, and so on. If you decide to do the articles, write to<br>our press attach� in Berlin, telling him who you are, and that you&#x2019;ve<br>had the idea for them yourself. He will ask you to send him one in the<br>post. The Gestapo will read it, and pass it on. You will then receive your<br>first fee and suggestions for future stories. The last-but-one letters of<br>the opening sentence will spell out the name of a city outside Germany<br>which you can reach fairly easily. Prague, perhaps, or Cracow. You will<br>spend the last weekend of the month in that city, and be sure to make<br>your hotel reservation at least a week in advance. Once you are there,<br>someone will contact you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll think about it,&#x201d; Russell said, mostly to avoid further argument.<br>He wanted to spend his weekends with Paul, and with Effi, his girlfriend,<br>not the Shchepkins of this world.<br><br>The Russian nodded and let himself out. As if on cue, the Polish<br>choir lapsed into silence.<br>RUSSELL WAS WOKEN BY the scream of a locomotive whistle. Or at<br>least, that was his first impression. Lying there awake all he could<br>hear was a gathering swell of high-pitched voices. It sounded like a<br>school playground full of terrified children.<br><br>He threw on some clothes and made his way downstairs. It was still<br>dark, the street deserted, the tramlines hidden beneath a virginal<br>sheet of snow. In the train station booking hall across the street a couple<br>of would-be travelers were hunched in their seats, eyes averted,<br>praying that they hadn&#x2019;t strayed into dangerous territory. Russell strode<br>through the unmanned ticket barrier. There were trucks in the goods<br>yard beyond the far platform, and a train stretched out past the station<br>throat. People were gathered under the yellow lights, mostly families<br>by the look of them, because there were lots of children. And there<br>were men in uniform. Brownshirts.<br><br>A sudden shrill whistle from the locomotive produced an eerie<br>echo from the milling crowd, as if all the children had shrieked at<br>once.<br><br>Russell took the subway steps two at a time, half-expecting to find<br>that the tunnel had been blocked off. It hadn&#x2019;t. On the far side, he<br>emerged into a milling crowd of shouting, screaming people. He had<br>already guessed what was happening&#x2014;this was a kindertransport,<br>one of the trains hired to transport the ten thousand Jewish children<br>that Britain had agreed to accept after Kristallnacht. The shriek had<br>risen at the moment the guards started separating the children from<br>their parents, and the two groups were now being shoved apart by<br>snarling brownshirts. Parents were backing away, tears running down<br>their cheeks, as their children were herded onto the train, some waving<br>frantically, some almost reluctantly, as if they feared to recognize<br>the separation.<br><br>Further up the platform a violent dispute was underway between an<br>SA Truppf�hrer and a woman with a red cross on her sleeve. Both were<br>screaming at the other, he in German, she in northern-accented English.<br>The woman was beside herself with anger, almost spitting in the<br>brownshirt&#x2019;s eye, and it was obviously taking everything he had not to<br>smash his fist into her face. A few feet away one of the mothers was<br>being helped to her feet by another woman. Blood was streaming<br>from her nose.<br><br>Russell strode up to the brownshirt and the Englishwoman and<br>flashed his Foreign Ministry press accreditation, which at least gave the<br>man a new outlet for his anger.<br><br>&#x201c;What the fuck are you doing here?&#x201d; the Truppf�hrer shouted. He<br>had a depressingly porcine face, and the bulk to go with it.<br><br>&#x201c;Trying to help,&#x201d; Russell...</p><h2>The Potent Self: A Study of Spontaneity and Compulsion</h2><p>Moshe Feldenkrais, D.Sc., a visionary scientist who pioneered the field of mind-body education and therapy, has inspired countless people worldwide. His ability to translate his theories on human function into action resulted in the creation of his technique, now known as the Feldenkrais Method of Somatic Education. In <i>The Potent Self</i>, Feldenkrais delves deeply into the relationship between faulty posture, pain, and the underlying emotional mechanisms that lead to compulsive and dependent human behavior. He shares remarkable insights into resistance, motivation, habit formation, and the place of sex in full human potential. <i>The Potent Self</i> offers Feldenkrais' vision of how to achieve physical and mental wellness through the development of authentic maturity. This edition includes and extensive Forward by Mark Reese, a longtime student of Feldenkrais, in which Reese discusses many of the important ideas in the book and places them in the context of Feldenkrais' life and the intellectual and historical milieu of his time.</p><p>Moshe Feldenkrais, D.Sc., is the founder of what is today called the Feldenkrais Method. As a result of suffering debilitating injuries, Feldenkrais began an intense exploration into the relationship between bodily movement and healing, feeling, thinking, and learning. In the process of healing himself, Feldenkrais made revolutionary discoveries, culminating in the development of the method that now bears his name. There are two aspects to his method: an individual manipulatory technique of neuromotor education called Functional Integration and a group technique called Awareness Through Movement. His unique and subtle approach to facilitating human change and to improving functioning is spelled out in a number of influential books, including: <i>Awareness Through Movement</i>, <i>Body and Mature Behavior</i>, and <i>The Elusive Obvious</i>. Dr. Feldenkrais is also the author of a number of books about Judo and one of the first Europeans to hold a black belt in the art. Today there are nearly four thousand Feldenkrais Method Practitioners around the globe. His insights contributed to the development of the new field of somatic education and continue to influence disciplines such as the arts, education, psychology, child development, physical and occupational therapy, sports enhancement, and gerontology."The heritage of Moshe Feldenkrais proves its mettle year by year, as his original vision takes root among the thousands of practitioners and students who carry his method forward. His often brilliant turns of mind are scattered among a handful of books left to posterity. <i>The Potent Self</i> is one of the most important."<br>&#x2014;Don Hanlon Johnson, Professor of Somatics, California Institute of Integral Studies; editor of <i>Groundworks and Bone, Breath, and Gesture</i><br><br>"The radical roots of Moshe Feldenkrais&#x2019; Method are clearly apparent in this book, displaying how his work evolved from his concerns about the deleterious effect of family and society upon the growth and development of human beings. Mark Reese&#x2019;s new Foreword beautifully traces the historical and cultural context in which the book came about, and brings to life the current relevance of Feldenkrais&#x2019; thinking of fifty years ago. <i>The Potent Self</i> is still potent. It is well worth reading and rereading."<br>&#x2014;Carl Ginsburg, Ph.D., Feldenkrais Trainer<br><br>"Moshe Feldenkrais has created a towering body of knowledge. There is no other theory or practice that delves so knowingly and deeply into the relationship between the body, its reflexes, its habitual levels of muscular tension, and gravity. Feldenkrais [is] as seminal to somatics as Freud was to psychology."<br>&#x2014;Robert Shaw, M.D., Medical Director, The Family Institute of Berkeley, CA</p><h2>Confident Color: An Artist&#39;s Guide To Harmony, Contrast And Unity</h2><p><b>Learn how to use color in your own unique and expressive way!</b><br><br>Color is what you make it: sensitive, explosive, dreamlike, atmospheric, somber, cheerful. <b>Nita Leland</b> brings logic and intuition together to create a foundation for color selections that allow you to be more inventive, break out of old habits and experiment with new colors.

Each volume also offers a section on ghosts and haunted places, a surefire draw for young adventurers. Trails are initially marked on a large map of the city and progress logically from one geographic point to the next, using high-quality photos and colorful cartoon illustrations to describe each attraction. One vertical two-page photo presents the tallest or most iconic structure in each city (New York's Statue of Liberty, London's Shard, and Paris's Eiffel Tower). Informational blurbs are short, concise, and well written, with occasional vocabulary (e.g., kinetic) explained in context. Fun facts are highlighted in scallop-edged boxes, and specific bits of research appear in periodic smartphone images. Famous (and infamous) landmarks (e.g., Central Park, the Globe Theatre, and Versailles) are featured in each, but unusual places (e.g., Drummer's Grove, Spitalfields, and the Wall of Love) also make the cut, as do fun activities, such as playing music on a New York subway art installation, eating Blumenthal's "meat fruit" (London), and walking through a Parisian "living" horror show.

Written for those for whom cooking is an act of love, Janet Reich Elsbach&#x2019;s cookbook [presents] recipes designed to soothe a new mother&#x2019;s frazzled nerves and welcome the new arrival; others are designed to comfort the grieving, nourish and cheer someone recovering from an illness, or celebrate life&#x2019;s milestones."&#x2014;<i>Foreword Reviews&nbsp;<br><br></i>"<i>Extra Helping</i>&nbsp;takes a look at how helping people with meals in times of stress not only provides nourishment, but comfort and pleasure at times when all can be in short supply."&#x2014;<i>The Boston Globe<br><br><i>"Extra Helping</i></i>&nbsp;has a mission: Get you to cook not just for yourself, your family, the occasional dinner party, but also for those who need it most&#x2014;your community. This humble cookbook (no styled shiny photos of styled roast chickens here) is organized by those in need of a warm meal. 'Food for expanding families' includes musings on motherhood alongside tofu skewers with roasted carrot romesco. If you know anyone who&#x2019;s been recently 'rearranged and relocated,' like a new neighbor or coworker, make them a 'life is upside down cake.' This book has soul and spirit. Give it to someone who does, too, with a jar of ready-to-spoon cookie dough."&#x2014;<i>Bon Appetit</i><br><br>"These are recipes to give to a friend who has lost a loved one, a student facing exams or the neighbors who have just moved in next door. As she simmers the soup, Elsbach shares experiences as a mother and a counselor for nursing mothers and her own times of loss. With warmth and humor, she reaches out to people in pain and all those who care for them."&#x2014;<i>Berkshire Magazine<br><br></i>"Elsbach&#x2019;s recipes are incredibly thoughtful. Those included in the first section, 'Food for Expanding Families,' take into consideration that a new parent might, for instance, need to eat standing up, straight from the fridge, in the middle of the night; and that breastfeeding newborns rarely appreciate garlic and onions in Mom&#x2019;s dinner. In these instances, Elsbach&#x2019;s suggestions range from carnitas and super-savory ground kebabs to citrusy grilled tofu skewers and noodles with options. Oh, and sunset-to-sunrise oats which &#x2014; you guessed it &#x2014; can be eaten any time of the day, from sunset to sunrise, warm or cold.

In her idea of a perfect world, every day would include high tea or wearing a fabulous hat, or both. This adoration of all things U.K. inspired her to write the Hat Shop Mysteries, which are set in London, one of her most favorite cities in the world. She now gets to visit there regularly&#x2014;for research purposes of course.<br> &nbsp;<br> In addition to being the author of the Hat Shop Mysteries, including <i>Copy Cap Murder</i> and <i>At the Drop of a Hat.</i> Jenn also writes the Cupcake Bakery Mysteries and the Library Lover&#x2019;s Mysteries.Chapter 1<br><br>"You know everyone says that French waiters are rude, but I don't think our waiter is rude at all," I said to my cousin, Vivian Tremont. "He seems very pleasant."<br><br>"That's because he's trying to sleep with you, Scarlett," Vivian said. "Why do you think our bottle of La Bodice Cheverny was on the house?"<br><br>"Seriously? Free wine for a tussle in the sheets, do I look that easy?" I asked. "Well, that is rude."<br><br>"Uh-huh," she said. Which was only slightly better than "I told you so," but not much.<br><br>It was late evening in Paris, the City of Light, and we were enjoying a nosh as Viv, who is British, would say. We were seated inside the Bistro Renee on Rue Saint Charles.<br><br>The bitter wind that whipped down the smaller streets from the Seine River could not get us here. We had ducked inside to eat but also to get warm.<br><br>Thankfully, the food did not disappoint. I ordered quail with roasted spring onions while Viv indulged in suckling pig with salsify, which is a lot like a parsnip, and we shared a baguette seasoned with the mellow heat of the Espelette pepper from the Basque region, or so our waiter, David, informed us when asked.<br><br>He was very charming and quite good-looking with his wavy dark hair and golden eyes. He told us his father owned the bistro, which was named for his mother, Renee, who had passed away when David was just a boy. Honestly, he broke my heart a little with that story but not enough to have a sleepover with him.<br><br>The small restaurant was everything a late meal in Paris should be. Candlelight, soft music in the background, an exotic blossom of some sort in a blue bottle on our small square table swathed in a pristine white cloth with matching napkins.<br><br>The crumbs of the baguette and the near empty bottle of sauvignon blanc sat on the table between us. We had scraped our plates clean. We did share as only cousins who live together like sisters can with some squabbling over what exactly was equitable and over who had ordered the tastier dish. I had, but Viv refused to admit it because I am her younger American cousin and she refuses to acknowledge that I am just as cultured as she is.<br><br>I glanced out the window. It was beautiful but it was not exactly the Paris of my dreams. Instead of sitting on an outside patio enjoying the warm floral-scented breeze of spring, we were swathed in scarves and sweaters, sitting inside a small caf&#x17d; watching a January snowfall.<br><br>Why were we here? Here's the short version. Viv is an acclaimed London milliner hired to teach a one-week hat-making class at the local art school. I am Scarlett Parker, not just her cousin but also part owner in our millinery business housed on Portobello Road in Notting Hill, London, which we inherited six years ago from our grandmother Mim.<br><br>Now because I know you're going to ask, since everyone does, the answer is no, positively, unequivocally no. I can't make a hat to save my life. So what am I doing here with her?<br><br>I'm sorry, did you miss the part that we're in Paris? Yes, even in January it's still Paris. Besides, the fact is that while Viv is an amazing artist, she's not the best with people. That's where I come in.<br><br>Viv being a creative type is known to occasionally be impulsive. I am generally the voice of reason when this happens but unfortunately when she decided on a whim to elope, she neglected to mention it to me thus I couldn't stop her. This was a couple of years ago while I was busy ruining my own life in a bad relationship.<br><br>In hindsight, we were both reeling from the loss of our grandmother Mim and neither of us were making good choices in our grief. Why is hindsight always so much clearer than foresight?<br><br>Anyway, after a few weeks of marriage, Viv ditched her husband without properly ending her marriage, and last she knew he was in Paris, so my mission, if I chose to accept it, which I did, was to find her husband and get him to agree to an annulment. Easy peasy, right?<br><br>Right. In the meantime, I needed to scrape off our waiter.<br><br>"Well, I'm not going to sleep with him," I said. "But I will finish off the wine."<br><br>"Naturally," Viv said.<br><br>I poured the remainder into our two glasses. Viv raised her glass and I did the same. We gently tapped them together.<br><br>"To finding your husband," I said. She blanched.<br><br>Okay, that was me being a buzzkill but also keeping her on task. Viv can be sly when she wants to be as evidenced by the fact that she got married and never told me. I mean, honestly, who does that?<br><br>"How about to returning home happier than when we arrived," she offered instead.<br><br>"I like that," I said. "It leaves it nice and open-ended for all possibilities."<br><br>"Precisely," she said.<br><br>We drained our glasses.<br><br>We declined coffee and a dessert, although I was tempted by the lemon cannoli, and a request for my phone number. In all honesty, I really felt that David must be vision impaired as I have the fiery hair and freckles of my dad's ginger-infused DNA while Viv has the milky complexion and long blond curls of our grandmother. In a beauty competition, Viv beats me hands down every time, yes, even when I put in great effort. Good thing I learned to get by on my personality years ago.<br><br>When we stepped outside, the chill wind was relentless, pushing us down the street like we were wayward teenagers being forced home before curfew. I tightened the scarf about my neck and jammed the cuffs of my leather gloves up into the sleeves of my jacket. I really despise the cold.<br><br>It was a short walk to Madame Leclaire's apartment building, where the Paris School of Art was housing us for the duration of Viv's class. It was a charming place located on the edge of the fifteenth arrondissement within walking distance of the Eiffel Tower. Built of white stone with a blue mansard roof, it was four stories tall containing eight small apartments with the added bonus of a communal living room and dining room on the main floor, where Madame Leclaire served a continental breakfast every day and a nightcap in the evenings.<br><br>The furniture in our apartment was a mashup of antiques with modern accessories. We each had a twin bed and a large armoire in our rooms, which were connected by a sitting room with a kitchenette. We were on one of the upper floors and our apartment had large windows with narrow wrought iron balconies. Mostly, our view was of the similar building across the way and the street below, but if I pressed my body against the glass and angled my head just right, I could glimpse a sliver of the Eiffel Tower to the north of us.<br><br>The house was warm and safe and Madame Leclaire, who ran it, was lovely and charming and always seemed to have the best wine and cheese on hand. That is a wonderful quality in an apartment building owner.<br><br>With our scarves wrapped around our heads, conversation was impossible as we hurried down the street. The snow was getting sharper as it pelted my back, pushing me toward my fluffy soft bed. I really didn't need the encouragement.<br><br>The lights were on in the front room of Madame Leclaire's. Viv and I picked up our pace. We dashed up the steps and hurried into the vestibule. Viv pressed the intercom and called a cheery, "Hello, we're home."<br><br>We had a key, but if Madame Leclaire was about, we could use the intercom and she would buzz us in. The inside door opened with a click and we pushed through with the eagerness of schoolgirls looking for cookies after a long day. Warmth washed over us and Madame Leclaire popped her head out of the communal sitting room on the first floor.<br><br>"Girls, you look frozen, you should come and sit by the fire." She gestured for us to follow her. Honestly, with her alluring French accent, I would have followed her anywhere, but the fire seemed like an excellent suggestion.<br><br>We did not need to be asked twice. Well, Viv might have, she's British, and they do hem and haw a lot in a show of good manners, but I am American and I do not. I walked right into the cozy room without hesitation and plopped myself in a darling chair right in front of the fire.<br><br>"This is heaven," I said. I peeled off my short wool coat and let the heat from the flames wash over me.<br><br>"Would you care for some hot chocolate?" Madame Leclaire offered. "Usually, I serve something stronger in the evening, but with the snow, I felt like chocolate was most appropriate."<br><br>"Oh, we don't want to trouble you," Viv said at the same time I said, "Yes, please."<br><br>Madame Leclaire glanced between us and smiled, amused no doubt by how different we were. She was much too polite to say so, however.<br><br>Madame was tall and lithe, with a cap of dark curls about her heart-shaped face that were just beginning to go gray. Her lips were wide and generous and her eyes a rich, trustworthy brown. I had liked her immediately when we arrived the day before, and she had been nothing but gracious and kind to us, which just reinforced my first impression.<br><br>This evening she wore tailored black slacks and a crisp raspberry blouse, which was mostly covered by the charcoal gray cashmere wrap she had draped about her shoulders, giving her a look that was both chic and comfy at the same time. You simply cannot outdress the French, and I would never be stupid enough to try.<br><br>Viv perched on the edge of the seat across from mine as if getting ready to bail the moment she felt her presence was an imposition. I burrowed deeper into my chair.<br><br>A silver pot with a random collection of mismatched china cups sat on the table in front of the couch, where Madame Leclaire resumed her seat. A cup of half-drunk chocolate sat on a coaster and beside it a French novel was facedown on the highly polished wooden table.<br><br>Now I wondered if we had intruded upon Madame Leclaire's quiet time. But I thought not, because the other cups on the tray indicated that she was open to company.<br><br>As if she was reading my thoughts, she took a delicate china cup and poured the piping hot chocolate into it. She placed it on a mismatched saucer and handed it to me. The steam rising out of the cup smelled a little like I've always imagined heaven would smell, assuming of course that there is one and that I am invited.<br><br>Madame Leclaire looked at Viv as if trying to determine if she wanted chocolate or if she was about to flee the room.<br><br>"Yes?" she asked as she held up the pot.<br><br>"Thank you, Madame Leclaire," Viv said. "You are most kind."<br><br>"Please call me Suzette," she said. "Most of my tenants do."<br><br>"Most?" I asked. "Which ones don't?"<br><br>"The ones I don't like," she said.<br><br>Viv and I both laughed at the wicked gleam in her eye.<br><br>"We are very honored that you like us," I said. Then I added, "Suzette."<br><br>Viv sipped her hot chocolate and I saw her spine relax as she melted into her chair. There really is nothing a good cup of cocoa can't cure.<br><br>"You start your class tomorrow?" Suzette asked.<br><br>"Yes, bright and early," Viv said. "Monsieur Martin said he would be by to escort me."<br><br>"He is very attentive," Suzette said. "Do you both teach millinery or do you teach something different, Ms. Parker?"<br><br>"Scarlett, please," I said.<br><br>"And I'm Vivian, or Viv, if you prefer," Viv chimed in.<br><br>"I don't teach anything," I said. "I have no artistic ability at all. The last hat I tried to make looked like a very bad brioche."<br><br>Suzette covered her mouth with one delicate hand and laughed. "I am sure that is not true."<br><br>"Oy, it's true," Viv said with the candor only a cousin could manage without it being a slam to the ego.<br><br>"What will you do with your time then, Scarlett, while Viv is teaching?"<br><br>"I am going to be looking for her husband," I said.<br><br>Viv gasped and Suzette's perfectly arched eyebrows rose almost to her hairline. Even surprise looked good on her.<br><br>"I am afraid I do not comprehend," Suzette said. "You are looking for a husband for your cousin?"<br><br>"No, I'm actually looking for her husband," I said. "She misplaced him."<br><br>Viv glowered at me and I shrugged.<br><br>"What?" I asked. "You did. Besides, maybe Suzette can help me figure out where to start."<br><br>"But of course, if there is anything I can do to help, I will do so gladly," she said.<br><br>"See?" I said to Viv. She continued glowering at me and I was pretty sure she growled deep in her throat but then she sipped her cocoa and seemed to settle back down again.<br><br>"But do explain to me how you misplace a husband," Suzette said. She smiled over the edge of her own cup. "I may need to know how to do that one day."<br><br>Chapter 2<br><br>Our apartment was cold. I burrowed deeper under my thick duvet, trying to ignore the pale light coming through my window. It couldn't be morning yet, I refused to accept it.<br><br>I had almost drifted back to sleep when the door to my bedroom crashed open and Viv came dashing into the room.<br><br>"Scarlett, wake up," she cried. "I need to talk to you."<br><br>No, no, no! I clenched my eyes tight, refusing to be ordered about when I was unconscious and trying to remain that way. I didn't move, hoping if she thought I was dead asleep, or perhaps plain old dead, she would go away.<br><br>My covers were abruptly yanked off my body, exposing my flannel pajamas with the yellow rubber ducks on them to the crisp morning air. I yelped and scrambled to pull them back over me, although I wasn't sure if it was the cold or the embarrassment over my sleeping attire that made me move faster.<br><br>Viv wasn't having it, however, and maintained her grip, forcing me into a tug of war over my own blankets.<br><br>"Viv! Stop it!" I cried. "I'm going to freeze to death and it will be all your fault."<br><br>"Then pay attention, because I need you to make me a promise," she said. "Wait. What are you wearing?"</p><h2>Flying Too High : a Phryne Fisher Mystery</h2><p><p><strong>"...the incomparable Phryne Fisher...beautiful, wealthy, sophisticated, but, above all, daring and intelligent..." &#x2015;<em>Library Journal</em></strong><em></em></p><p>Walking the wings of a Tiger Moth plane in full flight would be more than enough excitement for most people, but not for Phryne&#x2015;amateur detective and woman of mystery, as delectable as the finest chocolate and as sharp as razor blades.</p><p>In fact, the 1920s' most talented and glamorous detective flies even higher here, handling a murder, a kidnapping, and the usual array of beautiful young men with style and consummate ease. And she does it all before it's time to adjourn to the Queenscliff Hotel for breakfast. Whether she's flying planes, clearing a friend of homicide charges, or saving a child, Phryne does everything with the same dash and elan with which she drives her red Hispano-Suiza.</p></p><p><p>Kerry Greenwood was born in the Melbourne suburb of Footscray and after wandering far and wide, she returned to live there. She has degrees in English and Law from Melbourne University and was admitted to the legal profession on the 1st April 1982, a day which she finds both soothing and significant. Kerry has written three series, a number of plays, including <em>The Troubadours</em> with Stephen D'Arcy, is an award-winning children's writer and has edited and contributed to several anthologies. The Phryne Fisher series (pronounced Fry-knee, to rhyme with briny) began in 1989 with <em>Cocaine Blues</em> which was a great success. Kerry has written twenty books in this series with no sign yet of Miss Fisher hanging up her pearl-handled pistol. Kerry says that as long as people want to read them, she can keep writing them. In 2003 Kerry won the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Australian Association.</p>Stephanie Daniel&#39;s narrations of Kerry Greenwood&#39;s Australian mysteries are such delicious pleasure one worries that listening to them will pile on the pounds. Have no fear. Hearing Phryne Fisher&#39;s adventures in 1920s Melbourne is calorie free and as satisfying as high tea followed by a champagne dinner. The plot involves a kidnapped child, a murder, and Phryne doing some airplane wing-walking as well as mystery solving. Daniel&#39;s own Australian accent is light and easy; her voice is a pleasurable alto during the narrative sections, and in between she offers a wealth of character portrayals. Everyone from Phryne, an upper-crust Brit, to little children, to Australian good old boys is believable--and a joy to spend time with.

Strunk begins with the basic rules of usage, offering accessible explanations of correct punctuation and grammar. The Elements of Style is some kind of examples&#39; collection of all kinds of styles of writing very different works. The greatest book of its kind, this volume is a must for any student, teacher and writer.</p><p>William Strunk, Jr., was a professor of English at Cornell University and author of the The Elements of Style.

It will not worry in a year of drought or cease producing fruit.&#x201d;<br><br>But how do people really grow? <i>Transformational Discipleship</i> describes the process that brings to life that kind of person described in the Bible. There&#x2019;s no magic formula or mantra to recite here, but rather a substantive measure of research with churches and individuals who have wholeheartedly answered the call of Jesus to make disciples.<br><br>A compilation of their wisdom and stories, it surely guides church leaders and members to practice the intentional efforts needed to foster an entire culture in which people grow in Christian faith.<br><br>And they will grow, not because of human research, but by the power of the Word and of the Holy Spirit working through the church&#x2014;the same way disciples have always been made.

His feet were splayed at right angles, his left arm sticking out behind like the handle of a teacup. His fencing armor made him look like a walking quilt. Even with his sword pointed straight at her, he looked barking silly.<br><br>&#x201c;Do I have to stand like <i>that</i>?&#x201d; she asked.<br><br>&#x201c;If you want to be a proper fencer, yes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A proper idiot, more like,&#x201d; Deryn muttered, wishing again that her first lesson were someplace less public. A dozen crewmen were watching, along with a pair of curious hydrogen sniffers. But Mr. Rigby, the bosun, had forbidden swordplay inside the airship.<br><br>She sighed, raised her saber, and tried to imitate Alek&#x2019;s pose.<br><br>It was a fine day on the <i>Leviathan</i>&#x2019;s topside, at least. The airship had left the Italian peninsula behind last night, and the flat sea stretched in all directions, the afternoon sun scattering diamonds across its surface. Seagulls wheeled overhead, carried by the cool ocean breeze.<br><br>Best of all, there were no officers up here to remind Deryn that she was on duty. Two German ironclad warships were rumored to be skulking nearby, and Deryn was meant to be watching for signals from Midshipman Newkirk, who was dangling from a Huxley ascender two thousand feet above them.<br><br>But she wasn&#x2019;t really dawdling. Only two days before, Captain Hobbes had ordered her to keep an eye on Alek, to learn what she could. Surely a secret mission from the captain himself outweighed her normal duties.<br><br>Maybe it was daft that the officers still thought of Alek and his men as enemies, but at least it gave Deryn an excuse to spend time with him.<br><br>&#x201c;Do I look like a ninny?&#x201d; she asked Alek.<br><br>&#x201c;You do indeed, Mr. Sharp.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, you do too, then! Whatever they call ninnies in Clanker-talk.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The word is &#x2018;<i>Dummkopf</i>&#x2019;&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But <i>I</i> don&#x2019;t look like one, because my stance isn&#x2019;t dreadful.&#x201d;<br><br>He lowered his saber and came closer, adjusting Deryn&#x2019;s limbs as if she were a dummy in a shop window.<br><br>&#x201c;More weight on your back foot,&#x201d; he said, nudging her boots farther apart. &#x201c;So you can push off when you attack.&#x201d;<br><br>Alek was right behind her now, his body pressing close as he adjusted her sword arm. She hadn&#x2019;t realized this fencing business would be so touchy.<br><br>He grasped her waist, sending a crackle across her skin.<br><br>If Alek moved his hands any higher, he might notice what was hidden beneath her careful tailoring.<br><br>&#x201c;Always keep sideways to your opponent,&#x201d; he said, gently turning her. &#x201c;That way, your chest presents the smallest possible target.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Aye, the smallest possible target,&#x201d; Deryn sighed. Her secret was safe, it seemed.<br><br>Alek stepped away and resumed his own pose, so that the tips of their swords almost touched. Deryn took a deep breath, ready to fight at last.<br><br>But Alek didn&#x2019;t move. Long seconds passed, the airship&#x2019;s new engines thrumming beneath their feet, the clouds slipping slowly past overhead.<br><br>&#x201c;Are we going to fight?&#x201d; Deryn finally asked. &#x201c;Or just <i>stare</i> each other to death?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Before a fencer crosses swords, he has to learn this basic stance. But don&#x2019;t worry&#x201d;&#x2014;Alek smiled cruelly&#x2014;&#x201c;we won&#x2019;t be here more than an hour. It&#x2019;s only your first lesson, after all.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What? A whole barking hour ... without moving?&#x201d; Deryn&#x2019;s muscles were already complaining, and she could see the crewmen stifling their laughter. One of the hydrogen sniffers crept forward to snuffle her boot.<br><br>&#x201c;This is nothing,&#x201d; Alek said. &#x201c;When I first started training with Count Volger, he wouldn&#x2019;t even let me hold a sword!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, that sounds like a daft way to teach someone sword fighting.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Your body has to learn the proper stance. Otherwise you&#x2019;ll fall into bad habits.&#x201d;<br><br>Deryn snorted. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d think that in a fight <i>not moving</i> might be a bad habit! And if we&#x2019;re just standing here, why are you wearing armor?&#x201d;<br><br>Alek didn&#x2019;t answer, just narrowed his eyes, his saber motionless in the air. Deryn could see her own point wavering. She set her teeth.<br><br>Of course, barking <i>Prince</i> Alek would have been taught how to fight in the proper way. From what she could tell, his whole life had been a procession of tutors. Count Volger, his fencing master, and Otto Klopp, his master of mechaniks, might be the only teachers with him now that he was on the run. But back when he&#x2019;d lived in the Hapsburg family castle, there must have been a dozen more, all of them cramming Alek&#x2019;s attic with yackum: ancient languages, parlor manners, and Clanker superstitions. No wonder he thought that standing about like a pair of coatracks was educational.<br><br>But Deryn wasn&#x2019;t about to let some stuck-up prince outlast her.<br><br>So she stood there glaring at him, perfectly still. As the minutes stretched out, her body stiffened, her muscles beginning to throb. And it was worse inside her brain, boredom twisting into anger and frustration, the rumble of the airship&#x2019;s Clanker engines turning her head into a beehive.<br><br>The trickiest part was holding Alek&#x2019;s stare. His dark green eyes stayed locked on hers, as unwavering as his sword point. Now that she knew Alek&#x2019;s secrets&#x2014;the murder of his parents, the pain of leaving home behind, the cold weight of his family squabbles starting this awful war&#x2014;Deryn could see the sadness behind that gaze.<br><br>At odd moments she could see tears brightening Alek&#x2019;s eyes, only a fierce, relentless pride holding them back. And sometimes when they competed over stupid things, like who could climb the ratlines fastest, Deryn almost wanted to let him win.<br><br>But she could never say these things aloud, not as a boy, and Alek would never meet her eyes like this again, if he ever learned she was a girl.<br><br>&#x201c;Alek ...,&#x201d; she began.<br><br>&#x201c;Need a rest?&#x201d; His smirk wiped her charitable thoughts away.<br><br>&#x201c;Get stuffed,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I was just wondering, what&#x2019;ll you Clankers do when we get to Constantinople?&#x201d;<br><br>The point of Alek&#x2019;s sword wavered for a moment. &#x201c;Count Volger will think of something. We&#x2019;ll leave the city as soon as possible, I expect. The Germans will never look for me in the wilds of the Ottoman Empire.&#x201d;<br><br>Deryn glanced at the empty horizon ahead. The <i>Leviathan</i> might reach Constantinople by dawn tomorrow, and she&#x2019;d met Alek only six days ago. Would he really be gone so quickly?<br><br>&#x201c;Not that it&#x2019;s so bad here,&#x201d; Alek said. &#x201c;The war feels farther away than it ever did in Switzerland. But I can&#x2019;t stay up in the air forever.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, I reckon you can&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Deryn said, focusing her gaze on their sword points. The captain might not know who Alek&#x2019;s father had been, but it was obvious the boy was Austrian. It was only a matter of time before Austria-Hungary was officially at war with Britain, and then the captain would never let the Clankers leave.<br><br>It hardly seemed fair, thinking of Alek as an enemy after he&#x2019;d saved the airship&#x2014;two times now. Once from an icy death, by giving them food, and the second time from the Germans, by handing over the engines that had allowed them all to escape.<br><br>The Germans were still hunting Alek, trying to finish the job they&#x2019;d started on his parents. <i>Someone</i> had to be on his side....<br><br>And, as Deryn had gradually admitted to herself these last few days, she didn&#x2019;t mind if that someone wound up being her.<br><br>A fluttering in the sky caught her attention, and Deryn let her aching sword arm drop.<br><br>&#x201c;Hah!&#x201d; Alek said. &#x201c;Had enough?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Newkirk,&#x201d; she said, trying to work out the boy&#x2019;s frantic signals.<br><br>The semaphore flags whipped through the letters once more, and slowly the message formed in her brain.<br><br>&#x201c;Two sets of smokestacks, forty miles away,&#x201d; she said, reaching for her command whistle. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the German ironclads!&#x201d;<br><br>She found herself smiling a little as she blew&#x2014;Constantinople might have to wait a squick.<br><br>The alarm howl spread swiftly, passing from one hydrogen sniffer to the next. Soon the whole airship rang with the beasties&#x2019; cries.<br><br>Crewmen crowded the spine, setting up air guns and taking feed bags to the fl�chette bats. Sniffers scampered across the ratlines, checking for leaks in the <i>Leviathan</i>&#x2019;s skin.<br><br>Deryn and Alek cranked the Huxley&#x2019;s winch, drawing Newkirk down closer to the ship.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll leave him at a thousand feet,&#x201d; Deryn said, watching the altitude markings on the rope. &#x201c;The lucky sod. You can see the whole battle from up there!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But it won&#x2019;t be much of a battle, will it?&#x201d; Alek asked. &#x201c;What can an airship do to a pair of ironclads?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My guess is, we&#x2019;ll stay absolutely still for an hour. Just so we don&#x2019;t fall into any bad habits.&#x201d;<br><br>Alek rolled his eyes. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m serious, Dylan. The <i>Leviathan</i> has no heavy guns. How do we fight them?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A big hydrogen breather can do plenty. We&#x2019;ve got a few aerial bombs left, and fl�chette bats ...&#x201d; Deryn&#x2019;s words faded. &#x201c;Did you just say &#x2018;we&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Pardon me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You just said, &#x2018;How do <i>we</i> fight them?&#x2019; Like you were one of us!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I suppose I might have.&#x201d; Alek looked down at his boots. &#x201c;My men and I <i>are</i> serving on this ship, after all, even if you are a bunch of godless Darwinists.&#x201d;<br><br>Deryn smiled again as she secured the Huxley&#x2019;s cable. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll make sure to mention that to the captain, next time he asks if you&#x2019;re a Clanker spy.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How kind of you,&#x201d; Alek said, then raised his eyes to meet hers. &#x201c;But that&#x2019;s a good point&#x2014;will the officers trust us in battle?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why wouldn&#x2019;t they? You saved the ship&#x2014;gave us engines from your Stormwalker!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, but if I hadn&#x2019;t been so generous, we&#x2019;d still be stuck on that glacier with you. Or in a German prison, more likely. It wasn&#x2019;t exactly out of friendship.&#x201d;<br><br>Deryn frowned. Maybe things <i>were</i> a squick more complicated now, what with a battle coming up. Alek&#x2019;s men and the <i>Leviathan</i>&#x2019;s crew had become allies almost by accident, and only a few days ago.<br><br>&#x201c;You only promised to help us get to the Ottoman Empire, I suppose,&#x201d; she said softly. &#x201c;Not to fight other Clankers.&#x201d;<br><br>Alek nodded. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what your officers will be thinking.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Aye, but what are <i>you</i> thinking?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll follow orders.&#x201d; He pointed toward the bow. &#x201c;See that? Klopp and Hoffman are already at work.&#x201d;<br><br>It was true. The engine pods on either side of the great beastie&#x2019;s head were roaring louder, sending two thick columns of exhaust into the air. But to see the Clanker engines on a Darwinist airship was just another reminder of the strange alliance the <i>Leviathan</i> had entered into. Compared to the tiny British-made engines the ship was designed to carry, they sounded and smoked like freight trains.<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe this is a chance to prove yourself,&#x201d; Deryn said. &#x201c;You should go lend your men a hand. We&#x2019;ll need good speed to catch those ironclads by nightfall.&#x201d; She clapped him on the shoulder. &#x201c;But don&#x2019;t get yourself killed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll try not to.&#x201d; Alek smiled and gave her a salute. &#x201c;Good luck, Mr. Sharp.&#x201d;<br><br>He turned and ran forward along the spine.<br><br>Watching him go, Deryn wondered what officers down on the bridge were thinking. Here was the <i>Leviathan</i>, entering battle with new and barely tested engines, run by men who should by all rights be fighting on the other side.<br><br>But the captain didn&#x2019;t have much choice, did he? He could either trust the Clankers or drift helplessly in the breeze. And Alek and his men had to join the fight or they&#x2019;d lose their only allies. Nobody seemed to have much choice, come to think of it.<br><br>Deryn sighed, wondering how this war had got so muddled.<br><br>� 2010 Scott Westerfeld</p><h2>The Russia Account</h2><p><b>"Longtime Coonts fans who share his political leanings will best appreciate this outing."&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br> <br> <b>"The story moves along at a brisk pace, with plenty of intrigue, which will please thriller fans."</b><b>&#x2014;<i>Booklist</i></b><br> <br> <b>"Since switching publishers a few years back, Coonts has consistently delivered high-powered, conspiracy-laden political thrillers that are perfect for fans of Vince Flynn and Brad Thor."&#x2014;<i>Real Book Spy</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> It Starts with a Murder . . .

Tempering the need to fictionalize for the sake of a good story with the need for honesty, she creates interchapters that tell the reader what she has inferred or invented. Photographs.<br></p><p>MARY MCCARTHY (1912&#x2013;1989) was a short-story writer, bestselling novelist, essayist, and critic. She was the author of The Stones of Florence and Birds of America, among other books.A perhaps misleadingly restrictive title for a folio of some eight autobiographical pieces dealing with Mary McCarthy's past when as the eldest of "poor Roy's children"- her parents died during the influenza epidemic of 1918- she shuttled between two sets of grandparents and three religions- Catholic, Protestant and Jewish. Under the monitory supervision of the Catholic McCarthys in Minneapolis, the four young ones were turned over to a blood relative, Aunt Margaret- a "well-aged quince of 45" whose regimen of prunes and parsnips, no toys or books was supplemented by the capricious brutality of her husband Myers. Removed by "the Protestants", her grandfather Preston and his Jewish wife, to Scattle, there followed a period of quieter discipline in a Catholic convent where she lost her faith; the transfer to an Episcopalian boarding school and infractions of another nature; a summer in Montana and her introduction to whisky under the tutelage of a married druggist; and the pieces conclude with an unforgettable portrait of her grandmother Augusta Morgenstern and the elaborate ritual of her days.... Time has not dulled the sharpness of the image and incident here, and the portraiture has an exceptional definition to which the polished prose- there is never a flubbed phrase- is certainly contributory. There is also a warmth, and an often gamine charm, absent from her fiction, which may attract others beyond her anticipated audience (although Catholic readers have already been aroused on the initial publication of these pieces.)&nbsp; (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>)</p><h2>Survivors of the Holocaust: (A Graphic Novel)</h2><p><p><em>Between 1933 and 1945, Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party were responsible for the persecution of millions of Jews across Europe.</em></p><p>This extraordinary graphic novel tells the true stories of six Jewish children and young people who survived the Holocaust.

Of two things only do I feel assured. The first is that, as unchanging things do not grow -- rocks remain rocks -- informed changes of mind should be welcomed, not feared. The second is this: the unexamined Christ is not worth having."</i><br> -- from the introduction&nbsp;<br><br> In this book, which he describes as "my personal testimony to doubt seeking understanding," Dale Allison thoughtfully addresses ongoing historical-theological questions concerning Jesus. What should one think of the modern quest for the historical Jesus when there is such enduring discord among the experts, and when personal agendas play such a large role in the reconstructions? How much history is in the Gospels, and how much history does Christian theology require that there be? How does the quest impinge upon conventional Christian beliefs, and what might it contribute to contemporary theological reflection?&nbsp;<i>The Historical Christ and the Theological Jesus</i>&nbsp;is the personal statement of lessons that a respected participant in the quest has learned throughout the course of his academic career.</p><p>Dale C. Allison Jr. is Richard J. Dearborn Professor of New Testament Studies at Princeton Theological Seminary.<b>Beverly Roberts Gaventa, Princeton Theological Seminary</b><br> "With his singular combination of learning, wit, honesty, and humility, Dale Allison here reflects on the theological limitations and implications of the study of the historian's Jesus. Students at every level will find themselves instructed and even provoked by Allison's comments, but they will also come away agreeing that 'the unexamined Christ is not worth having.'

Allison is both refreshingly robust in his appraisals of the work of colleagues and disarmingly honest in his self-criticisms."</p><h2>Pretty Monsters</h2><p><b>The crossover literary sensation...now in paperback! </b> <br><br> Through the lens of Kelly Link's vivid imagination, nothing is what it seems, and everything deserves a second look. From the multiple award- winning "The Faery Handbag," in which a teenager's grandmother carries an entire village (or is it a man-eating dog?) in her handbag, to the near-future of "The Surfer," whose narrator (a soccer-playing skeptic) waits with a planeload of refugees for the aliens to arrive, these ten stories are funny and full of unexpected insights and skewed perspectives on the world. Kelly Link's fans range from Michael Chabon to Peter Buck of R.E.M. to Holly Black of Spiderwick Chronicles fame. Now teens can have their world rocked too!</p><p>Kelly Link lives in Northampton, Massachusetts, where she and her husband, Gavin J. Grant, run Small Beer Press and publish the zine <i>Lady Churchill&#x2019;s Rosebud Wristlet</i> (www.lcrw.net)."Readers as yet unfamiliar with Link ("Magic for Beginners") will be excited to discover her singular voice in this collection of nine short stories, her first book for young adults. The first entry, &#x201c;The Wrong Grave,&#x201d; immediately demonstrates her rare talents: a deadpan narration that conceals the author's metafictional sleight-of-hand ("Miles had always been impulsive. I think you should know that right up front"); subjects that range from absurd to mundane, all observed with equidistant irony. Miles, hoping to recover the poems he's buried with his dead girlfriend, digs up what appears to be the wrong corpse ("It's a mistake anyone could make," interjects the narrator), who regains life and visits her mother, a lapsed Buddhist ("Mrs. Baldwin had taken her Buddhism very seriously, once, before substitute teaching had knocked it out of her"). Other stories have more overtly magical or intertextual themes; in each, Link's peppering of her prose with random associations dislocates readers from the ordinary. With a quirky, fairytale style evocative of Neil Gaiman, the author mingles the grotesque and the ethereal to make magic on the page."&#x2013;<b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b>, starred review<p></p><p>"Although some of Link&#x2019;s work appears in other YA and adult short-story anthologies, this is her first collection wholly aimed at a young-adult audience. Weirdly wonderful and a touch macabre, the nine short stories take readers into worlds with elements of reality but also supply a fantastic twist. The opening story, &#x201c;The Wrong Grave,&#x201d; plays into the current trend of books featuring the dead and the undead; in it, a boy whose girlfriend dies wants to dig her up to retrieve the poems he put in her coffin. &#x201c;Magic for Beginners&#x201d; centers on a boy whose closest friendships form around a TV show with a loyal following but no set broadcast time or channel. Erudite, economical word choices give readers a strong sense of setting without drowning them in adjectives. The humor is dry and the characters are easy to relate to, even in alien (literally and figuratively) settings. Fantasy readers used to long, single tomes may hesitate at the short-story format, but once they see these, they will want more."&#x2013;<b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b>, starred review</p><p>"Link, who has two breathlessly received books of strange, surrealistic tales for adults under her belt, makes the leap into the YA fold with this collection of short stories (most previously published in separate anthologies) that tug at the seams of reality, sometimes gently, sometimes violently. In nearly every one of these startlingly, sometimes confoundingly original stories, Link defies expectations with such terrific turnarounds that you are left precipitously wondering not only &#x201c;What&#x2019;s going to happen now?&#x201d; but also &#x201c;Wait, what just happened?&#x201d; Her conception of fantasy is so unique that when she uses words like ghost or magic, they mean something very different than they do anywhere else. Perhaps most surprisingly&#x2014;and memorably&#x2014; is Link&#x2019;s dedicated deadpan delivery that drives home how funny she can be, no matter how dark the material gets. After gobbling up a group of campers, a monster with a self-proclaimed sense of humor bargains with the terrified lone survivor, &#x201c;How about if I only eat you if you say the number that I&#x2019;m thinking of? I promise I won&#x2019;t cheat. I probably won&#x2019;t cheat.&#x201d; Shaun Tan contributes a handful of small illustrations that are, of course, just plain delightful."&#x2013;<b><i>Booklist</i></b>, starred review</p><p>"In her first collection of stories for young adults, Link upends traditional horror, science fiction, and fantasy motifs, creating original, quirky, and distinctly beautiful literary landscapes. Honed, brilliant language renders blood, werewolves, ghosts, magic, and monsters sublime&#x2013;at times even funny. Readers will relish uncertainty in these savory, strange stories and never feel quite sure of their footing. They proceed giddily, jumping from one uncanny premise, phrase, or image to the next, eventually stumbling upon a revelation that hits them like the snap of a rubber band. Clever resolutions and tricky plots place teens on delightfully circuitous reading paths. Unexpected endings force them to double back and reconsider each story from the beginning. In this second read, young adults might notice Link&#x2019;s seamless incorporation of their own experiences. Awkward adolescence, uncomfortable first love, frustrating parents, and complicated friendships surface quietly amid wonderfully knotty, twisted plots and incandescent imagery. This compilation of intricate, transfixing selections succeeds in making the weird wonderful and the grotesque absolutely gorgeous."&#x2013;<i><b>School Library Journal</b></i></p><p></p></p><h2>The Art of Polymer Clay Millefiori Techniques: Projects and Inspiration for Creative Canework</h2><p>A thousand and one ideas for making beautiful polymer clay millefiori.

Hardly the makings of a page-turner, yet Ron Hansen's <i>Mariette in Ecstasy</i> is a gripping, even life-changing book. For the Sisters of the Crucifixion, each day is a ceaseless round of work, study, and prayer--one hardly separate from the other. Their daily life is itself an act of devotion, caught here in a series of illuminated tableaux: hundreds of yellow butterflies alighting on eight gray habits, moving through a field; a sister praying as she "turns over a great slab of dough that rolls as slowly as a white pig"; nuns warming their hands on the flanks of horses, swinging scythes through timothy grass, crushing grapes with their feet. <p> Into this idyll comes Mariette--young, pretty, devout, but, as her father says, perhaps "too high-strung" for the convent. Prone to "trances, hallucinations, unnatural piety, great extremes of temperament, and, as he put it, 'inner wrenchings,'" Mariette scalds her hands with hot water as penance, threads barbed wire underneath her breasts while she sleeps, and is convinced Jesus speaks to her. Her very glamour disturbs the gentle rhythm of the nuns' lives. But when she begins bleeding from unexplained wounds in her hands, feet, and sides, the convent is thrown into an uproar. Is Mariette a saint? Or just a lying, hysterical girl? Where do we draw the line between madness and faith, mysticism and eroticism, the life of the spirit and that of the world?</p><p> It's to Hansen's credit that he never provides easy answers. Mariette's stigmata may or may not be genuine; the novel's achingly gorgeous prose is the true miracle here. <i>Mariette in Ecstasy</i> is a brief, precious book, not a single word in excess, not a single word left out. <i>--Mary Park</i></p><p>Ron Hansen is the bestselling author of the novel <em>Atticus</em> (a finalist for the National Book Award), <em>Hitler's Niece</em>, <em>Mariette in Ecstasy</em>, <em>Desperadoes</em>, and <em>Isn't It Romantic?</em>, as well as a collection of short stories, a collection of essays, and a book for children. <em>The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford</em> was a finalist for the PEN/Faulkner Award.

She lives in Chester Springs, PA. therootconnection.blogspot.comWe've featured an extract from this book on page 60 of this month's issue; if you've already looked over Sujata Shah's Crazy Quilt then you'll know that the author is an inspired designer. Sujata has a unique perspective on the craft, being born in Mumbai and moving to the USA later. She describes in her introduction how as an adolescent she would love fabrics but found sewing crushingly dull, telling her mother she would &#x2018;rather die than hold a needle'! Later in life, after moving to the States and getting married, she discovered a love of quilting, luckily for us, and took much inspiration from fusing the styles of her native India and American folk art and Amish quilting. The resulting projects are a sight to see! The 15 free form block projects featured in this book are a celebration of this &#x201c;melting pot,&#x201d; and brim with ideas. The book is accompanied, refreshingly, with photographs illustrating some of the inspirations and stories behind the projects, and it's a pleasure to see how Sujata has translated them into works of quilted excellence. (<i>Popular Patchwork, May 2015</i>)<br><br>The author of this book grew up in Mumbai, India, and now lives in Pennsylvania, USA. A graphic designer and quilter, she finds inspiration all over the world- in the quilts from Gee's Bend, the Indian godharis and the bold, colorful fabrics from Africa. In this book she shows how to make vivid, free-form quilts from traditional quilt blocks such as Rail Fence, Windmills or Square in a Square with a simple stack, cut, shuffle, and stitch technique. She also provides alternative setting suggestions for each project. A colorful and inspiring book. Highly recommended! (<i>Down Under Quilts Magazine, January 2015</i>)<br><br>I love everything about Indian design and color and this book rocked me from the opening and short show-n-tell of hand embroidered wallhangings, and printed fabrics. I love the techniques that the designer shows us in her book although they are not totally unfamiliar to me, as American free-form quilters have been using, teaching, and writing about these techniques for years. Yet, for some reason, the work and process spelled out in this book is speaking to me now. Wow. Maybe it's because the focus and simplicity of both the quiltmaking and the process of patchwork, has been unabashedly simplified and not used as a mere precursor for some kind of unattainable museum-worthy free form fabric masterpiece. All of her piecework is so liberating and freeing and, it had occurred to me, this freedom in cutting and free-form sewing might be just the thing a bored quilter might need to get out of her/his creative rut.I also want to give Shah props for including the additional layer of fiber-interest for including photographs that inspired her individual projects, like pottery, textiles, carved wood, African textiles, etc. I really enjoyed reading and learning the effortless techniques Shah teaches us in the book that are used to achieve the different patchwork patterns...

Many are unable and unwilling to share the gospel, convinced that it's not their "gift."<br><br>True disciples do more than the minimum, explains Hull. They choose the life and commit to bringing Jesus to the lost. They live out their beliefs and walk the walk. Submission shows the doubting world that Christ is embedded in their character. <br><br>Choose the Life is a practical tool as accessible to laypeople as ministry leaders. Any church seeking life-changing significance will be challenged by this cutting-edge resource.

He believes that the Great Commission has more to do with spiritual depth than strategies and structures. Jesus is calling us to choose the life of thinking as he thought, living as he lived, loving as he loved, ministering as he ministered, and leading as he led. Anything less is Christ-less Christianity. <br><br>"This book is worth the price simply for Bill's elegant, comprehensive, penetrating five-fold definition of what a disciple is."--Brian McLaren, author of A New Kind of Christian<br><br>"Bill Hull reminds us that being a Christian and being Christlike are synonymous.

So he joined the service, becoming a commander of a forty-man infantry platoon called <b>Joker One</b>. Campbell had just months to train and transform a ragtag group of brand-new Marines into a first-rate cohesive fighting unit, men who would become his family. They were assigned to Ramadi, the capital of the Sunni-dominated Anbar province that was an explosion just waiting to happen. And when it did happen&#x2014;with the chilling cries of "Jihad, Jihad, Jihad!" echoing from minaret to minaret&#x2014;Campbell and company were there to protect the innocent, battle the insurgents, and pick up the pieces. <br><br>Thrillingly told by the man who led the unit of hard-pressed Marines, <b>Joker One</b> is a gripping tale of a leadership and loyalty.</p><p>Donovan Campbell graduated with honors from Princeton University and Harvard Business School, finished first in his class at the Marines&#x2019; Basic Officer Course, and served three combat deployments&#x2013;two in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. He was awarded the Combat Action Ribbon and a Bronze Star with Valor for his time in Iraq. He is now working for PepsiCo and living in Dallas, Texas, with his wife and daughter.<i>Chapter One<br><br></i><br>I found myself fascinated by the interesting geometric designs of the twisted iron rebar in front of me. For a time, my eyes traced each of the dark, thumb-thick strands where they spewed out of the cinder-block walls like the frozen tentacles of some monster from the myths of antiquity.<br><br>I have no idea how long I spent engrossed in contemplation, because time in and around firefights is somewhat fluid, but eventually I tore myself away from profound admiration of the destruction in front of my eyes. It was difficult, this return to a reality that sometimes seemed more like a myth&#x2014;or maybe a nightmare&#x2014;but it was necessary, because the problem immediately at hand was all too real. If I ignored it for too long, I might get everyone around me killed.<br><br>So I stepped back from the abandoned building' s wall and surveyed the floor around me. Somewhere in the various piles of newly created rubble scattered about the floor were pieces of the rockets that had just ripped through two feet of cinder block to explode inside my observation post (OP). I needed to find at least one of these pieces, preferably the base of the warhead, because this was the first time that my unit had been hit by rockets capable of doing this much damage. If I could find a piece, then we could figure out what kind of rockets these were, estimate what it would take to launch them, and predict how they would be used in the future. We could then effectively plan to thwart them and potentially save several lives, which was important to me because my job description was twofold: 1) save lives and 2) take lives. Not necessarily in that order.<br><br>With these considerations in mind, I sifted diligently through the rubble until I found what I was looking for: a smooth black object, just a little larger than a hockey puck, with a half dozen or so holes drilled through it. Though the little puck looked fairly innocuous, I knew from hard-won experience that it was actually a thing of great pain; it was the base of one of the rockets that had just struck us. Without stopping to think, I grabbed the thick circular object as firmly as I could, shrieked manfully, and then dropped it as quickly as I could. Even ten minutes after its firing, this part of the explosive warhead was still hot enough to sear my palm. Important safety lesson: When picking up a newly fired enemy rocket warhead base, allow proper time for cooling <i>or </i>handle it with gloves. I filed that one away with other lessons learned the hard way, right after "RPGs (rocket propelled grenades) that you need to worry about always make two booms" and "No one here is your friend." We now lived in a bizarre world where explosions were so commonplace that we had ways of distinguishing the more from the less harmful and where little tips and tricks about proper expended rocket handling made perfect sense to collate, absorb, and pass on. The absurd had become our baseline.<br><br>Ten minutes ago, though, the world was very simple, for it consisted solely of something that seemed like one gigantic explosion. Actually, it was three separate large explosions within half seconds of one another, but it's fairly difficult to make the distinction when you're lying on your back with your ears ringing. However, it's fairly easy to think rapidly and incoherently, which was exactly what I was doing as I lay on my back, wondering whether my hearing would return this time, and, incidentally, what in the hell had just happened to me and my men.<br><br>Time, I already knew, would answer the former question without any help from me, but as the lieutenant and the unit leader, it was my job to answer the latter one, and time in this case was working against me. If you're a Marine lieutenant in a firefight, a situation that's probably as good a proxy as any for hell, then it's your job to figure out at least 50 to 70 percent of what is going on around you so that you can make intelligent decisions, which translate into good orders, which lead to focused, effective, and decisive action. This whole process needs to be rapid to be relevant, but if you' re too hasty, then you can lead your men to their deaths, all the while believing that you're leading them to safety. It's not an easy tension to manage on an ongoing basis.<br><br>However, it can be done, and to do it well you must have absolutely no concern for your own safety. You can't think of home, you can't miss your wife, and you can' t wonder how it would feel to take a round through the neck. You can only pretend that you're already dead and thus free yourself up to focus on three things: 1) finding and killing the enemy, 2) communicating the situation and resulting actions to adjacent units and higher headquarters, and 3) triaging and treating your wounded. If you love your men, you naturally think about number three first, but if you do you're wrong. The grim logic of combat dictates that numbers one and two take precedence.<br><br>After the explosions, I rose, ears still ringing, and grabbed for the radio handset. Once the black handset was pressed firmly against my ear, I pushed the button with my thumb and, as calmly as I could manage, informed headquarters that my eleven men and I had just been hit by several large rockets. There were probably multiple casualties, I said, and maybe some of us were dead, but I didn't know just yet. I'd call back. Headquarters squawked something in return, but, with my hearing still questionable and one of our machine guns firing full bore inside the all-concrete building, I couldn't understand a word, so I told HQ I'd be back in touch when I could hear again. Then I put the handset down and resolutely ignored it until I could sort out what was going on inside the old abandoned hotel that my eleven-man squad and I were using as an observation position.<br><br>After five minutes of running helter-skelter through the thick dust that the rockets had kicked up, I found Sergeant Leza, my squad leader, and we conferred. Slowly the pieces of the attack came together to form a coherent picture: The massive explosion, which we assumed to be the rockets, had kicked off the insurgent assault. Seconds after their impact, one enemy from our southwest had fired an RPG at us but had missed, probably because one of my men had shot the insurgent as he took aim.<br><br>Simultaneously, several enemies off our southeast flank had sprayed the building with AK-47 fire, and the two Marines covering that sector had returned fire with their M-16s. They were unable to tell whether they had killed anyone. We had also taken some fire from our direct north and south, and the Marines in those positions, including my medium machine gunner, had reciprocated in spades. They, too, were unable to tell whether their return fire had had any effect. For the most part it was all pretty routine, with only two small deviations.<br><br>First off, directly across the street from our hotel, a car blazed furiously in an alleyway. I had seen burning cars before, but they were usually the result of either nearby bomb detonations or steady machine gun fire during particularly fierce combat. I had yet to see a burning car accompanied by a simultaneous rocket attack. I pushed the incongruity aside&#x2014;the more important question was how the enemy had managed to attack us with such powerful rockets, which were almost certainly antitank weapons and definitely not man-portable. Ten minutes later, my first squad, patrolling in from the north, called in with an answer: The backseat of the burning car bore the clear remains of a homemade-rocket launcher, still smoldering inside. Our attackers had simply parked the vehicle in an inconspicuous place next to the gates of a house, hoping that we would lose track of the nondescript vehicle amid the hustle and bustle of the thriving marketplace area below us. When the rest of the assault was ready, a spotter within the crowd had launched the rockets with a cellphone call.<br><br>The second small plot twist, however, was that no United States Marines were wounded or killed in this story, a very unusual thing for a Ramadi day in August 2004. In spite of their clever plan and their disciplined execution, our enemies had failed&#x2014;we hadn' t stopped our mission for even a second. Indeed, we had probably winged at least one of our attackers, although it's sometimes difficult to tell because most people don't go down when you shoot them with our little .223 bullets. So on that day, I believed that God had been watching over us. Up to that point, even with the horrors I had witnessed,<br><br>I retained my faith, if only barely. Every time events made me ready to throw in the towel, a small miracle happened&#x2014;like antitank rockets missing our floor&#x2014;or I saw something supernaturally beautiful in the actions of one of my Marines, and for one more day, it was enough to keep faith and hope alive.<br>Now, nearly three years after that August day, those Marines and I have long since parted ways. Our time together in Iraq seems like someone else's story, for there's nothing in America even remotely similar to what we experienced overseas, nothing that reminds us of what we suffered and achieved together. And none of us have really been able to tell that story, not fully, not even to our families, because each small telling takes a personal toll. No one wants to suffer the pain of trying to explain the unexplainable to those who rarely have either the time or the desire to comprehend. So, many of us have simply packed our war away and tried hard to fit into normalcy by ignoring that time in our lives.<br><br>But our story is an important one, and I believe that it' s worth telling truthfully and completely no matter what the cost. For seven and a half months, from March to September 2004, my company of 120 Marines battled day in and day out against thousands of enemy fighters in a city that eventually earned the title of Iraq's most dangerous place, a city called Ramadi. Our story has been largely overshadowed by the two battles of Fallujah that bookended our deployment, battles in which the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) brought the full weight of its combat power&#x2014;jets, tanks, artillery, and so on&#x2014;to bear on a city populated almost entirely by insurgent fighters. Fallujah I and II have probably been the closest thing to conventional fighting since Baghdad fell, and they're a gripping story: intense, house-to-house combat between clearly defined foes&#x2014;the Marines on one side, the jihadists on the other&#x2014;with a negligible civilian population muddying the battlefield.<br><br>We, by contrast, fought a much blurrier battle, a classic urban counterinsurgency, a never-ending series of engagements throughout the heart of a teeming city where our faceless enemies blended seamlessly into a surrounding populace of nearly 350,000 civilians. These civilians severely limited the assets we could bring to the fight, negating entirely the artillery and air power that American forces invariably rely upon to win pitched battles. Thus my men and I usually fought on foot, street by street and house by house, using only what we could carry on our backs. Outnumbered and outgunnedin nearly every battle, we walked the streets of Ramadi endlessly, waiting, tensely, for another enemy ambush to kick off. For us there was no end to the mission, no respite from the daily violence&#x2014;for seven straight months we patrolled without ever having a single day off.<br><br>Indeed, we never experienced anything even remotely resembling a normal day, and as I searched my memory and my diary for one to bring the reader into our world, the brief August rocket attack was the best I could come up with&#x2014;nothing too terrible, just a standard day with a few little twists that made it slightly memorable.<br><br>During our entire deployment, I prayed for something other than this standard day, for a respite from the unrelenting pace of combat, but a break never came. Instead, we fought and fought and fought until, on our return, one out of every two of us had been wounded&#x2014;a casualty rate that, we were told, exceeded that of any other Marine or Army combat unit since Vietnam.<br><br>However, our perseverance and our sacrifices paid off. Despite the determined attacks of the insurgents, Ramadi never fell entirely into their hands as had its sister city Fallujah, and we retained control of the key thoroughfares and all the institutions of government until we were relieved by other Marines. Three weeks thereafter, Central Command doubled the U.S. forces in Ramadi, then tripled them. In early 2005, the Marine Corps formally honored our efforts by giving the Leftwich award to my company commander (CO), Captain Chris Bronzi. With this award, the USMC officially stated that it considered Captain Bronzi its best combat company commander (and our company as its best combat company) for all of 2004, a year that included both Fallujah invasions.<br><br>Throughout all the fighting, I led a forty-man infantry platoon&#x2014;onequarter of our company&#x2014;under the CO's command. Day after unrelenting day bound our platoon tightly together, eventually creating a whole much greater than the sum of its parts, and we grew to love one another fiercely. I knew these men better than my best friends; better, in some ways, than my wife. For what they did and what they suffered, my men deserve to have their story told.<br><br>But it's so hard to tell the truth, because the telling means dragging up painful memories, opening doors that you thought you had closed, and revisiting a past you hoped you had put behind you. However, I think that someone needs to do it, and I was the leader, so the responsibility falls to me.<br>I was neither born into the military nor bred for it&#x2014;aside from a two-year stint my grandfather did as an Air Force doctor, no one in my family had ever served in the armed forces. Indeed, the thought of joining the service never really occurred to me until my junior year at college, when I decided that the Marine Corps Officer Candidate School (OCS), the ten-week selection process that qualifies university students for an officer' s commission, would look good on my r�sum�.<br><br>With this less-than-altruistic motivation to spur me on, I headed down to Quantico, Virginia, to take in the ten weeks of uninterrupted screaming that constitutes OCS. Unsurprisingly, I hated the experience, and on the day I completed the course, I swore internally never, ever to join the Marine Corps. I hadn't done ROTC, and I hadn't accepted a dime from any of the services to help pay for college, so I didn't owe the military a thing. I intended for it to stay that way.<br><br>Over the course of my senior year, though, something shifted. Somehow, the Fortune 500 recruiters and the postgraduation salaries lost their luster, and, somewhat to my surprise, I soon found myself casting about for a pursuit that would force me to assume responsibility for something greater than myself, something that would force me to give back, to serve others. Try as I might to avoid them, I kept coming back to the United States Marines. I knew from OCS that if I could make it to the Marine infantry, then I could be a platoon commander and have forty men whose lives would be entirely my responsibility. I also knew that in the infantry I'd be in a place where I could no longer hide behind potential, a place where past academic achievements and family connections were irrelevant, a place where people demanded daily excellence in action because lives hung in the balance. As my final semester of school wound down, I thought of the words one of my sergeant instructors had screamed at me over the summer: "Candidate, the currency in which we trade is human lives. Do you think you can handle that responsibility?"<br><br>I didn't know if I could, but I did know that I wanted to try, and I knew that I wanted to learn to lead, ...</p><h2>Novels: The House of Mirth / The Reef / The Custom of the Country / The Age of Innocence (Library of America Edith Wharton Edition)</h2><p>The four novels in this Library of America volume show Wharton at the height of her powers as a social observer and critic, examining American and European lives with a vision rich in detail, satire, and tragedy.

Mariketa the Awaited asked the Lykae behind her without turning around. In the dark of a corridor leading to a burial chamber, Bowen MacRieve had been following her silently. But she'd <i>felt</i> him staring at her -- just as she had at the Talisman's Hie assembly three nights ago. </p><p> "No' likely, witch." How could such a rumbling Scots' burr sound so menacing? "I only stalk what I want to catch." </p><p> Mari did turn to slant him a glance at that, even knowing he couldn't see her face under the hood of the scarlet cloak she always wore. But by the light of her lantern hanging over her shoulder, she could see his, and used the cover to disguise her long, appreciative look. </p><p> She inwardly sighed. Lykae males were notoriously good-looking, and the few she'd seen had lived up to their reputation, but this one was heart-poundingly sexy. </p><p> He had black hair, stick straight and thick, reaching to the collar of his obviously expensive shirt. His body -- which she'd found herself thinking about frequently over the past few days -- was sublime. He stood a good bit over six feet tall, and though the corridor was wide enough for two normal-size people to pass, his broad shoulders and big, rangy build filled the space. </p><p> But even with all his many attractions, his eyes were what made him so unique. They were the color of rich, warm amber, and yet there was a kind of sinister light to them, which she liked. </p><p> She was a little sinister, too. </p><p> "Look your fill?" he asked, his tone scathing. Yes, he was sexy, but unfortunately, his dislike of witches was well known. </p><p> "I'm done with you," she answered, and meant it. She didn't have time to pine after brusque werewolf warriors if she planned to be the first of her kind ever to win the Hie, an immortal scavenger hunt � la <i>The Amazing Race</i>. </p><p> With an inward shrug, she continued on toward yet another burial chamber. This was the tenth she'd investigated over the hours she and several other competitors had been down deep inside this never-ending Mayan tomb. </p><p> She might have surprised him with her curt dismissal because a moment passed before he followed her. The only sounds in the echoing space were his heavy footfalls, which he no longer bothered to muffle. The silence between them was grueling. </p><p> "Who opened the stone slab to the tomb?" he finally asked, trailing far too closely behind her. </p><p> "The three elven archers and a couple of demons." The archers, two males and a female, were deadly shooters with lightning-quick speed, and the male rage demons were incredibly powerful -- second in physical strength only to the Lykae. Yet even for them, the stone portcullis sealing the tomb's entrance had been nearly impossible to budge. </p><p> They'd realized the entire pyramidal structure had shifted from time and earthquakes and now rested on the portcullis, making it weigh tons. Raising it had taken all of the others cooperating -- with the two demons lifting it and the archers shoving an enormous boulder under it to prop it open. </p><p> "And they just let you enter after their effort?" </p><p> She stopped and faced him again. "What should they have done, Mr. MacRieve?" The others had not only allowed her to enter. Though she barely knew any of them, they had wanted to work together since there were four prizes. Cade, one of the demons, had even helped her climb down the dozen feet from the outer entrance into the first anteroom. Then they'd all split up to cover the maze of chambers and vowed to the Lore to alert the others of a find. </p><p> MacRieve's smile was a cruel twist of his lips. "I know exactly what I would have done." </p><p> "I know exactly how I would have retaliated." He seemed surprised that she didn't fear him, but the truth was that she didn't spook easily -- when not faced with heights or unnecessarily large insects. And she was well aware of how vicious the Hie competitors could be as they raced around the world for prizes. </p><p> This ruthlessness in the Hie was why Mari had been sent by the House of Witches to compete, even though she was only twenty-three and hailed from the shady New Orleans coven, the slacker Animal House of witches. And even though she had not yet made the turn from mortal to immortal. </p><p> But Mari was not above trickery, and unlike many witches, she would not hesitate to use magick to harm another if they deserved it -- and if she could manage it with her volatile powers. </p><p> MacRieve closed in until nearly seven feet of seething werewolf male loomed over her. He was at least a foot taller than she was and hundreds of times stronger, but she forced herself to stand her ground. </p><p> "Watch your step, little witch. You doona wish to anger one such as me." </p><p> The grand prize for the Hie was an object called Thrane's Key, a key that allowed its possessor to go back in time -- not just once, but <i>twice</i>. For a tool like that, she knew he was ready to take her out of the contest. So she had to convince him that it was impossible for him to do so. </p><p> "Likewise, you shouldn't anger me." Her voice was steady as she looked up at him. "Remember that I could turn your blood to acid as an afterthought," she said, baldly lying. </p><p> "Aye, I've heard rumors of your power." He narrowed his eyes. "Curious, though, that you dinna open the tomb with one flick of your finger." </p><p> Yes, she might have managed to lift the portcullis -- with concentration, an unprecedented bout of luck, and the absence of a hangover. Oh, and if she were in mortal danger. </p><p> Unfortunately, her power was adrenaline-based, making it as infinite as it was uncontrollable. </p><p> "You think I should use magick like mine to open a tomb?" Mari asked in a scoffing tone. <i>Mistress of bluffing, working it here.</i> "That'd be like calling you in to lift a feather." </p><p> He tilted his head, sizing her up. After what seemed like an hour, he began walking again. </p><p> Mari gave an inward sigh of relief. If anyone in the Lore found out how vulnerable she really was, she'd be doomed. She knew this, but no matter how hard she worked, whenever she manifested and unleashed significant power, things ended up <i>exploding</i>. </p><p> As her befuddled mentor Elianna explained, "Horses have powerful legs -- but that doesn't mean they're prima ballerinas." The ancient Elianna trained with Mari daily to control the destructive nature of her spells, because she believed the subtle magicks invoked the most fear in their enemies. </p><p> And the House of Witches brokered in fear. </p><p> The corridor finally ended at a broad, high wall, covered in carvings of ghoulish faces and animals. Mari lifted her lantern high and the reliefs seemed to move in shadow. They'd apparently been put there to guard a small tunnel opening near the floor, which itself was made out like a gaping mouth with fangs dropping down. </p><p> She waved the Lykae forward. "Age before beauty, Mr. MacRieve." She sized him up again, then studied the small opening, which couldn't be more than three feet square. "If you think you can fit." </p><p> He stood motionless, clearly not about to be directed. "Only humans call me Mr. MacRieve." </p><p> She shrugged. "I'm not a human." Her mother was a fey druidess, and her late father had been a warlock of questionable repute. So Mari was a fey witch or a "weylock," as her buddies teased. "So would you like me to call you Bowen, or Bowe for short?" </p><p> "Bowe is what my friends call me, so you doona." </p><p> <i>What an ass</i>...."No problem. I have a slew of other more fitting names for you. Most of them end in <i>er</i>." </p><p> He ignored her comment. "You in the tunnel first." </p><p> "Don't you think it'd be unbecoming for me to be on my hands and knees in front of you? Besides, you don't need my lantern to see in the dark, and if you go first, you'll be sure to lose me and get to the prize first." </p><p> "I doona like anything, or anyone, at my back." He crossed his arms over his chest and leaned a shoulder against a snarling visage on the stone wall. She'd never seen a Lykae turn into its towering werewolf form, but knew from those who had that this male could be as frightening as any monster, real or imagined. "And you'll have your little red cloak on," he continued, "so I will no' be able to see anything about you that might be...unbecoming." </p><p> "Twisting my words? I'll have you know that I am criminally cute -- " </p><p> "Then why hide behind a cloak?" </p><p> "I'm not <i>hiding</i>." In fact, that was precisely what she was doing. "And I like to wear it." She <i>hated</i> it. </p><p> Even before her birth, she'd been predicted to be the Awaited One, the most powerful born to the House of Witches in centuries -- but four years ago, it was also foretold that a male from the Lore would recognize her as his own and claim her. He would seek to lock her away, guarding her with a ferocity that no magicks could defeat, thus robbing the House of her powers. </p><p> Since the prediction, she'd been forced to cover herself every single time she set foot outside her home. Needless to say, the robust dating life of her late teens had taken a hit. </p><p> She sported the cloak -- a red one because she was a Scarlet Letter-type rebel at heart -- and as a backup, she also hid behind a magickal glamour that disguised her looks, the tone of her voice, and her scent. </p><p> If a male like MacRieve did see her, he would perceive a brunette with blue eyes -- when in fact she was a redhead with gray eyes -- and he would have difficulty recalling anything that was the same, like her features, her figure, or the length of her hair. The glamour was so second nature that she hardly thought about it anymore. </p><p> Even with all these precautions, it followed that unattached males in the Lore were to be avoided. Yet Mari had heard at the Hie assembly -- a gossip fest if she'd ever seen one -- that MacRieve had already found his mate and lost her more tha...</p></p><h2>Piano Tuning: A Simple and Accurate Method for Amateurs (Dover Books On Music: Piano)</h2><p><p>If you have a note that has dropped in pitch, do you have to call in the tuner?

Stanton Evans challenges nearly every concept you&#39;ve learned in history classes from elementary school to college: that our liberties stem from secular doctrines, that religious absolutes endanger freedom, that the Bill of Rights created a &#34;wall of separation&#34; between religion and our public institution.

Just when and how they did so has been one of the most perplexing and controversial questions in archaeology. This dazzling, cutting-edge synthesis, written for a wide audience by an archaeologist who has long been at the center of these debates, tells the scientific story of the first Americans: where they came from, when they arrived, and how they met the challenges of moving across the vast, unknown landscapes of Ice Age North America. David J. Meltzer pulls together the latest ideas from archaeology, geology, linguistics, skeletal biology, genetics, and other fields to trace the breakthroughs that have revolutionized our understanding in recent years. Among many other topics, he explores disputes over the hemisphere&#39;s oldest and most controversial sites and considers how the first Americans coped with changing global climates. He also confronts some radical claims: that the Americas were colonized from Europe or that a crashing comet obliterated the Pleistocene megafauna. Full of entertaining descriptions of on-site encounters, personalities, and controversies, this is a compelling behind-the-scenes account of how science is illuminating our past.</p><p>"Meltzer's compelling account of the data and the debates takes readers behind the scenes of the often contentious arguments that have redirected the scientific pursuit of the first Americans."&#x2015;Tom D. Dillehay, author of <i>The Settlement of the Americas</i><br><br>"In remarkably comprehensive and lucid fashion, Meltzer synthesizes the complex and commonly conflicting evidence for the earliest human presence in the Americas and provides an honestly told lesson about the workings of scientific thought."&#x2015;David Hurst Thomas, author of <i>Skull Wars</i><br><br>"A natural storyteller, David Meltzer gives us a vivid picture of both the colonizing bands of humans who moved into the Americas and the researchers who followed their footsteps from Alaska to Chile. This is an insider's account, told with a keen eye and sense of humor, as if Meltzer were there when discoveries were made and when disputes were aired&#x2015;as, indeed, he often was."&#x2015;Ann Gibbons, author of <i>The First Human: The Race to Discover our Earliest Ancestors</i><br><br>"The settling of the Americas has been a first-rate scientific puzzle since Columbus stumbled across the peoples of the Caribbean. David Meltzer is its ideal chronicler: a major participant in the research that is unlocking the mystery and a fine writer with a wry humor.

I&#x2019;m not talking about the one against brain cancer...I&#x2019;m talking about the one against Donald Trump. He wages it in a forthcoming book, <i>The Restless Wave</i>...McCain has always believed, to his core, in sacrifice, honor and allegiance to something larger than oneself...Such grace is unimaginable from Trump. That&#x2019;s why it&#x2019;s so vital that McCain is using his waning time to model it.&#x201d; <b>&#x2014;Frank Bruni, <i>The New York Times</i></b><br><br>"You can see McCain in this book struggling to reconcile himself to what his Republican Party has largely become...The six-term senator from Arizona slips in a few careful mentions of Donald J. Trump, and expresses concern about the rancor that has overtaken the country...He consistently returns again and again to what seems for him to be a core commitment: a fervent belief in American exceptionalism...his faith in his country&#x2019;s beneficence remains undimmed." <b>&#x2014;Jennifer Szalai,&nbsp;<i>The New York Times</i></b><br><br>"In what may be his final public act, John McCain this month will publish a book that bequeaths us a rare gift....the volume does not burden us with a lot of high-minded advice based on lessons learned, nor does it pull us down into treacly memoir. McCain is still very much McCain....What he does offer, though, at this peculiar moment of our history, is far more precious: a reminder of the values and principles that our nation has long stood for, and a spur to us to recover from this unhealthy interlude and stand for them again. Without preaching, instead by recounting stories of battles won and (often) lost, McCain unspools something akin to a self-help manual for a country that has, at least for the moment, lost its way."<b> &#x2014;Fred Hiatt,&nbsp;<i>The Washington Post</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;It should be required reading for anyone who wants to lead in a democracy.&#x201d; <b>&#x2014;Senator Lindsey Graham, <i>The&nbsp;New York Times</i></b><br> <br> &nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;History matters to McCain, and for him America is and was about its promise. The book is his farewell address, a mixture of the personal and the political. 'I have loved my life,' he writes. 'All of it.'&nbsp;<i>The Restless Wave</i> is a fitting valedictory for a man who seldom backed down.&#x201d; <b>&#x2014;<i>The Guardian, US</i></b><br><br>"Remarkable....a book-length meditation on what it means to face the hard challenges of long life and the sobering likelihood of imminent death. John McCain&#x2019;s valedictory message, at the booksellers under the title <i>The Restless Wave</i>,&nbsp;is a 400-page reflection on hardship, a homily on purpose, a celebration of life &#x2014; and a challenge to Americans to live up to their values and founding principles at a time when both are in jeopardy." <b>&#x2014;<i>The Boston Globe</i></b><br><br>"This is not just a book that offers a vision of how politics might be done differently, it is essentially a blueprint for how to live a life well." <b>&#x2014;<i>The New Statesman</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In this thoughtful valedictory, [McCain] delivers...Unlike the previous six books McCain and Salter have composed together, this one wasn&#x2019;t written for voters. It was written for history...With what time he has left, the &#x201c;maverick&#x201d; &#x2014; an appellation he has worn throughout his career, at some times more comfortably than at others &#x2014; is going to put country first and tell the truth...His book will be remembered for its genuine concern about the future of our republic and the West.&#x201d; <b>&#x2014;James Hohmann,&nbsp;<i>The Washington Post</i></b><br><br>"McCain&#x2019;s <i>The Restless Wave</i> coalesces a series of poignant and striking warnings of the perils facing the United States, from Russian aggression worldwide to an escalated American divide and partisanship fights to isolationist efforts and racism...He also expresses a theme of gratitude for living a life larger than he envisioned."<b> &#x2014;<i>Stars and Stripes</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Written in McCain&#x2019;s plain-spoken, occasionally brusque manner, the senator and Vietnam war veteran...offers a wide-ranging appraisal of his own career, one marked by unrealized presidential ambitions and a lofty view of America on the international stage.&#x201d; <b>&#x2014;<i>The Guardian</i></b></p><h2>Gunmetal Magic</h2><p>Includes a free bonus: a Kate Daniels novella, "Magic Gifts"<br><br>The <i>New York Times </i>bestselling Kate Daniels novels have been hailed as &#x201c;top-notch urban fantasy&#x201d; (<i>Monsters and Critics</i>).

Candy jerked me up by my hair and slammed my face into the asphalt.</p><p><i>Thud!</i></p><p>&#x201c;Hit her again!&#x201d; Michelle squeaked, her teenage voice shrill.</p><p>I knew it was a dream, because it didn&#x2019;t hurt. The fear was still there, that sharp, hot terror, mixed with helpless rage, the kind of fear that turns you from a human being into an animal. Things become distilled to simple concepts: I was small, they were big; I was weak, they were strong. They hurt me, and I endured.</p><p><i>Thud.</i></p><p>My skull bounced off the pavement. Blood stained my blond hair. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Sarah take a running start like a kicker before a field goal. The flesh on her body boiled. Bones grew, muscles wound around them like cotton candy over a stick, hair sprouted, sheathing the new body, half human, half animal, in a coat of pale sandy fur dappled with telltale hyena spots. The bouda grinned at me, her malformed mouth full of fangs. I clenched up, curling my ten&#x2013;year&#x2013;old self into a ball. The clawed foot crashed into my ribs. The three&#x2013;inch claws scraped bone and it crunched inside me like a snapped chopstick. She kept kicking me.</p><p><i>Thud, thud, thud!</i></p><p>This was a dream. A dream grown from my memories, but still just a dream. I knew this, because ten years after my mother took eleven&#x2013;year&#x2013;old me and fled halfway across the country, I came back and put two bullets through Sarah&#x2019;s eyes. I had emptied a clip into Candy&#x2019;s left ear. I still remembered the way her skull had blossomed with red when the bullets tore out the other side. I had killed the entire werehyena clan. I wiped those bouda bitches off the face of the planet, because the world was a better place with them gone. Michelle was the only one who had escaped.</p><p>I sat up and grinned at them. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m waking up, ladies. Go fuck yourselves.&#x201d;</p><p>My eyes snapped open. I lay in my closet, wrapped in a blanket and holding a butcher knife. The door of the closet stood slightly ajar, and the gray light of early morning slipped through the narrow gap.</p><p>Fantastic. Andrea Nash, decorated veteran of the Order, hiding in her closet with her knife and a blankie. I should&#x2019;ve held on to the dream long enough to beat them into bloody pulp. At least then I wouldn&#x2019;t feel so completely pathetic.</p><p>I inhaled, sampling the air. The normal scents of my apartment floated to me, the hint of synthetic apple from the soap in the bathroom, the fragrance of vanilla from the candle by my bed, and strongest of all, the stench of dog fur, a leftover from when my friend Kate&#x2019;s poodle Grendel had kept me company. That freak of nature had slept at the foot of my bed, and his distinctive reek had permanently imprinted my rug.</p><p>No intruders.</p><p>The scents were muted, which meant the magic was down.</p><p><i>Thud&#x2013;thud&#x2013;thud!</i></p><p>What in the world?</p><p><i>Thud!</i></p><p>Someone was pounding on my door.</p><p>I kicked off my blanket, rolled to my feet, and ran out of the closet. My bedroom greeted me: my big bed, intruder&#x2013;free; the crumpled mess of the blanket on the rug; my jeans and bra, discarded last night by the bed, next to a Lorna Sterling paperback with a pirate in a poofy shirt on the cover; bookcase, stuffed to the brim; pale blue curtains on the barred window, undisturbed.</p><p>I dropped the butcher knife onto my side table, pulled on my pajamas pants, grabbed my Sig&#x2013;Sauer P226 from under the pillow, and ran to the door. Waking up with a gun in my hand would&#x2019;ve made a lot more sense, but no, I woke up clutching a knife. That meant I must&#x2019;ve gotten up in the middle of the night, ran into the kitchen, took a knife from the butcher block, ran back into the bedroom, grabbed a blanket, and hid in the closet. All without realizing where I was or what I was doing. If that wasn&#x2019;t crazy, I didn&#x2019;t know what was.</p><p>I hadn&#x2019;t slept with a knife since I was a teenager. This blast from the past wasn&#x2019;t welcome and it needed to go away real fast.</p><p><i>Thud&#x2013;thud!</i></p><p>I reached the door and stood on my toes to look through the peephole. A tall black woman in her fifties stood on the other side. Her gray hair stuck out from her head in a mess, she was wearing a nightgown, and her face was so twisted by worry, I barely recognized her. Mrs. Haffey. She and her husband lived in an apartment right below me.</p><p>Normally Mrs. Haffey viewed her appearance as serious business. In terms of battle readiness, she was my hero&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve never seen her without her makeup and hair perfectly done. Something was really wrong.</p><p>I unlocked the door.</p><p>&#x201c;Andrea!&#x201d; Mrs. Haffey gasped. Behind her long white strands covered the landing and the stairwell. I was one hundred percent sure they hadn&#x2019;t been there when I&#x2019;d dragged myself into my apartment last night.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Darin&#x2019;s missing!&#x201d;</p><p>I pulled her into my apartment and shut the door. &#x201c;I need you to tell me from the beginning, slowly and clearly: what happened?&#x201d;</p><p>Mrs. Haffey took a deep breath. She had been a cop&#x2019;s wife for twenty&#x2013;five years and her experience from dealing with a lifetime of emergencies kicked in. Her voice was almost steady. &#x201c;I woke up and made coffee. Darin got up to take Chief outside. I took a shower. When I came out, Darin wasn&#x2019;t back. I went out on the balcony, but he wasn&#x2019;t in his usual spot.&#x201d;</p><p>I knew exactly where the usual spot was, two stories under my bedroom window, where the Haffeys&#x2019; bulldog, Chief, preferred to mark his territory. I smelled it on my way to work every morning. Of course, Chief smelled my scent and it only made him more determined to pee his way to territorial supremacy.</p><p>&#x201c;I called and called Darin, and nothing. I tried to go downstairs. There&#x2019;s blood all over the landing and a white substance on the stairs and it&#x2019;s blocking the way.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did Mr. Haffey take his gun with him?&#x201d;</p><p>Mr. Haffey had retired from the Paranormal Activity Division of the Atlanta Police Department. PAD cops took their guns seriously. As far as I knew, Darin Haffey never left the house without his Smith &amp; Wesson M&amp;P340 snub&#x2013;nosed revolver.</p><p>&#x201c;He always takes his gun with him,&#x201d; Mrs. Haffey said.</p><p>And he hadn&#x2019;t fired it, because his revolver ate .357 Magnum cartridges. When he pulled the trigger, the shot sounded like a small cannon going off. I would&#x2019;ve heard the gunshot and recognized it even through the dream. Whatever happened, happened fast.</p><p>The mysterious &#x201c;white substance&#x201d; must&#x2019;ve appeared as a result of the magic wave last night. Kate, my best friend, had warded my apartment months ago. Invisible spells shielded my place in a protective barrier. She&#x2019;d covered the perimeter walls, the ceiling, and floor. Anything magic would have a hard time breaking in, which probably explained why I&#x2019;d slept safe and secure through the night.</p><p>&#x201c;You know Darin&#x2019;s blind as a bat.&#x201d; Mrs. Haffey twisted her hands. &#x201c;He can&#x2019;t even see what he&#x2019;s shooting at. The other day he comes running out of the bathroom, screaming and foaming at the mouth. He&#x2019;d brushed his teeth with Aspercreme instead of toothpaste . . .&#x201d;</p><p>A note of hysteria slipped into her voice. At five ten, she had eight inches of height on me and she was leaning over. &#x201c;I called down to the station, but they say it will be twenty minutes or longer. I thought since you were with the Order . . .&#x201d;</p><p>I used to be with the Order. When I was a Knight of Merciful Aid, it was my job to help people when the cops wouldn&#x2019;t or couldn&#x2019;t assist them with the magic hazmat. I had decorations and a stellar service record, but none of it mattered when the Order found out that I was a shapeshifter. They branded me mentally disturbed and unfit for duty and &#x201c;retired&#x201d; me.</p><p>But they didn&#x2019;t take away my training or my skills.</p><p>I pressed a latch in my wall. A panel slid aside, revealing a small niche that used to be a hallway closet and which I had converted into my own personal armory. A row of gun barrels gleamed in the morning light.</p><p>Mrs. Haffey clicked her mouth shut.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s see. I&#x2019;d be bringing my Sigs, but I needed something with more power. The AA&#x2013;12, an Automatic Assault 12&#x2013;gauge shotgun with a 32&#x2013;round clip was always a good choice. It fired 300 rounds per minute with minimal recoil. I filled mine with steel slugs. Squeeze the trigger once, and get a single shot that would punch through a car door. Hold the trigger, and anything on the other end, no matter how much hard body armor it wore, would become a smoking pile of meat in six and a half seconds. I&#x2019;d paid a fortune for it and it was worth every dollar.</p><p>I grabbed the AA&#x2013;12 and put on a hip holster, into which I stuck my Sig and its twin. &#x201c;Mrs. Haffey, I need you to stay here.&#x201d; I gave her a nice big smile. &#x201c;Lock the door behind me and don&#x2019;t open it until I come back. Do you understand?&#x201d;</p><p>Mrs. Haffey nodded.</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d;</p><p>I stepped onto the landing and heard the deadbolt slide shut behind me.</p><p>The &#x201c;white substance&#x201d; stretched in long pale strands over the walls. It resembled a spiderweb if the spider was the size of a bowling ball and instead of working in a spiral had decided to weave only in a vertical direction. I crossed the landing and inhaled. Usually there was an up&#x2013;draft here, the air rising from the front entrance to the top of the building. Today no movement troubled the stairway, but I smelled the sharp metallic odor of fresh blood all the same. Tiny hairs on the back of my neck stood up. The predator in me, the other me sleeping deep inside, opened her eyes.</p><p>I padded down the stairs, moving silently on the concrete steps, my shotgun ready. Even though magic made my existence possible, it didn&#x2019;t mean that magic and I played nice. Give me guns over spells any day.</p><p>The web grew thicker. At the Haffeys&#x2019; landing, it swallowed the walls and the wooden stair rail. I turned, heading down. The stench of blood assaulted my nostrils and I tasted it on my tongue. All of my senses went into overdrive. My heart beat faster. My pupils dilated, improving my vision. My breathing sped up. My hearing sharpened and I caught a distant noise, muffled, but unmistakable: the deep, throaty bark of a bulldog.</p><p>I took a few more steps down. Blood stained the stairs. A large amount, at least a couple of pints, possibly more, all in big round drops. Either someone bled and walked, or someone bled and was carried. Please don&#x2019;t be Darin. I liked Darin and I liked his wife. Mrs. Haffey was always kind to me.</p><p>The first floor landing was a narrow tunnel within the web. The door to apartment 1A was intact, but buried in white strands. The same solid wall of white sealed the way downstairs, and none of it was torn. No sign of Darin going that way. The door to 1B lay in a splintered wreck. Bloody marks stretched across the threshold, pointing into the apartment. Someone had been dragged inside.</p><p>I stepped into the hallway. A new scent tugged at me, a slightly sour, prickly odor that set off instinctual alarms in my head. Not good.</p><p>The apartment had the exact same layout as mine: a narrow hallway, opening into the kitchen on the right, the living room on the left, then the first bedroom, and then a short perpendicular hallway leading to the utility room and guest bathroom, and finally to the master bedroom with a bathroom en suite.</p><p>I moved in, nice and easy, slicing the pie around the corner: starting at the wall and moving at a ninety degree angle away from it, leaning slightly away from the wall to see the threat around the corner before it saw me. Jumping around the corners was very dramatic but would get your head blown off.</p><p>Kitchen&#x2014;clear.</p><p>I moved into the living room.</p><p>On the left, by a coffee table, sat a large wicker basket full of yarn. Two long wooden needles stuck out of it at an angle. Next to the basket lay a severed human arm. The blood had pooled from it, soaking the beige wall&#x2013;to&#x2013;wall carpet in a dark red stain.</p><p>Pale skin. Not Darin Haffey. No, this was likely Mrs. Truman who lived in this apartment with her two cats. She liked to play bridge with her knitting club and collected yarn for &#x201c;special&#x201d; projects, with which she never did anything. Now her torn&#x2013;off arm lay next to the basket with her knitting stash. No time to absorb and deal with it. I still had Darin to find.</p><p>I moved on. The sour prickly scent grew stronger.</p><p>Bedroom&#x2014;clear. Bathroom&#x2014;clear.</p><p>A huge hole gaped in the floor of the utility room. Something had smashed through the floor and tile from below.</p><p>I circled the hole, shotgun pointing down.</p><p>No movement. The floor below me looked clear.</p><p>A muffled noise cut through the quiet.</p><p>My ears twitched.</p><p><i>Woof! Woof!</i></p><p>Chief was still alive somewhere in there. I jumped into the hole, landed on the concrete floor of the basement, and moved away from the light streaming through the hole. No need to present a clear target.</p><p>Gloom filled the basement, dripping from the web into dark corners. The walls no longer existed. There was only web, white and endless.</p><p>My eyes adjusted to the darkness. Shapeshifter vision guaranteed that as long as there was some light, I wouldn&#x2019;t bump into things.</p><p>Wet dark smears marred the concrete. Blood. I followed it.</p><p>Ahead the concrete split. A long fissure ran through the floor, at least three feet wide. The apartment building was already none too sturdy. The magic hated tall buildings and gnawed on them, pulverizing brick and mortar until the structure crashed down. The bigger the building, the faster it fell. Ours was too short and too small and so far we had escaped unscathed, but giant holes in the basement didn&#x2019;t exactly inspire confidence.</p><p>A snorting noise came from inside the gap. I leaned over it. A whiff of dog fur stink washed over me. <i>Chief, you silly knucklehead.</i></p><p>I crouched by the hole. The bulldog squirmed below, snorting up a storm. He must&#x2019;ve fallen into the fissure and the drop was too sheer for him to jump out.</p><p>I put my shotgun on the ground and leaned in, grabbing Chief by the scruff of his neck. The bulldog weighed eighty pounds at least. What in the world were the Haffeys feeding him, small elephants? I yanked him out and jumped to my feet, shotgun in my hands. The whole thing took half a second.</p><p>Chief pressed against my leg. He was an Olde English Bulldogge, a throwback to the times when the English Bulldog was used for bull&#x2013;baiting. A powerful, agile dog, Chief feared neither garbage trucks, nor stray dogs or horses. Yet here he was, rubbing against my calf, freaked out.</p><p>I took a second to bend down and pet his big head. <i>It will be okay, boy. You&#x2019;re with me now.</i></p><p>We started forward, moving slowly out of the first narrow room into a wider chamber. The web spanned the walls, creating hiding spots in the corners. Creepy as hell.</p><p>I carefully rounded the corner. At the far wall to my right two furnaces sat side by side: the electric for the times when technology had the upper hand and the old&#x2013;fashioned coal&#x2013;burning monstrosity for use during the waves, when the magic robbed us of electric current. To the right of the coal furnace stood a large coal bin, a four&#x2013;foot&#x2013;high wooden enclosure filled with coal. On the coal, half&#x2013;buried, lay Mr. Haffey.</p><p>Two creatures crawled on the concrete in ...</p></p><h2>The Wonder Clock: Or, Four &amp; Twenty Marvelous Tales, Being One for Each Hour of the Day</h2><p>It is rare indeed when a writer's original stories are regarded as masterpieces on a par with the great folkloristic fairy tales that have been handed down through the ages.

A native of Wilmington, Delaware, he spent the last year of his life in Florence, Italy. In 1894 he began teaching illustration at the Drexel Institute of Art, Science and Industry (now Drexel University), and after 1900 he founded his own school of art and illustration called the Howard Pyle School of Illustration Art. The term the Brandywine School was later applied to the illustration artists and Wyeth family artists of the Brandywine region by Pitz (later called the Brandywine School). Some of his more famous students were Olive Rush, N. C. Wyeth, Frank Schoonover, Elenore Abbott, Ellen Bernard Thompson Pyle, Allen Tupper True, Anna Whelan Betts, Ethel Franklin Betts, Harvey Dunn, Philip R. Goodwin, and Jessie Willcox Smith. His 1883 classic The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood remains in print to this day, and his other books, frequently with medieval European settings, include a four-volume set on King Arthur that cemented his reputation. He wrote an original novel, Otto of the Silver Hand, in 1888. He also illustrated historical and adventure stories for periodicals such as Harper's Weekly and St. Nicholas Magazine. His novel Men of Iron was made into a movie in 1954, The Black Shield of Falworth. Pyle travelled to Florence, Italy to study mural painting in 1910, and died there in 1911 of sudden kidney infection (Bright's Disease).</p><h2>The Fortunes of Africa: A 5000-Year History of Wealth, Greed, and Endeavor</h2><p><b>A sweeping history the fortune seekers, adventurers, despots, and thieves who have ruthlessly endeavored to extract gold, diamonds, and other treasures from Africa and its people.</b><br><br>Africa has been coveted for its rich natural resources ever since the era of the Pharaohs.

Shrugging out of her suit jacket, she nudged off her heels and took slow, deep breaths. She sat collecting herself for a few moments, then tugged free the clip restraining her hair and massaged her scalp.<br><br>She was getting the start of a killer headache.<br><br>And her hands were still shaking.<br><br>She&#x2019;d nearly betrayed herself to the Fae.<br><br>She couldn&#x2019;t believe she&#x2019;d been so stupid, but, God, there were just too many of them this summer! She hadn&#x2019;t spotted a fairy in Cincinnati for years, but now, for some bizarre reason, there were oodles of them.<br><br>Like Cincinnati was some kind of great place to hang out&#x2014;could a city be more boring? Whatever their unfathomable reason for choosing the Tri-State, they&#x2019;d appeared in droves in early June, and had been ruining her summer ever since.<br><br>And pretending she didn&#x2019;t see them never got any easier. With their perfect bodies, gold-velvet skin, and shimmering iridescent eyes, they were a little hard to miss. Drop-dead gorgeous, impossibly seductive, dripping pure power, the males were a walking temptation for a girl to&#x2014;<br><br>Brusquely she shook her head to abort that treacherous thought. She&#x2019;d survived this long and was darned if she was going to slip up and get caught by one of the erotic&#x2014;exotic, she corrected herself impatiently&#x2014;creatures.<br><br>But sometimes it was so hard not to look at them. And doubly difficult not to react. Especially when one caught her off guard like the last one had.<br><br>She&#x2019;d been having lunch with Marian Temple, senior partner at the law firm of Temple, Turley and Tucker, at a posh downtown restaurant; a very critical lunch, during which she&#x2019;d been interviewing for a postgraduate position.<br><br>A soon-to-be-third-year law student, Gabby was serving a summer internship with Little &amp; Staller, a local firm of personal injury attorneys. It had taken her all of two days on the job to realize she was not cut out for representing pushy, med-bill-inflating plaintiffs who were firmly convinced their soft-tissue injuries were worth at least a million dollars per ache.<br><br>At the opposite end of the legal spectrum was Temple, Turley and Tucker. The most prestigious firm in the city, it catered to only the most desirable clients, specializing in business law and estate planning. What carefully selected criminal cases they chose to represent were renowned, precedent-setting ones. Ones that made a difference in the world, protecting fundamental rights and addressing intolerable injustices. And those were the cases she hungered to get her hands on. Even if she had to slave away for years, doing research and fetching coffee to get to them.<br><br>She&#x2019;d been stressed all week, anticipating the interview, knowing that TT&amp;T hired only the cream of the crop. Knowing she was competing against dozens of her classmates, not to mention dozens more from law schools around the country, in a cutthroat bid for a single opening. Knowing Marian Temple had a reputation for demanding nothing less than high-gloss sophistication and professional perfection.<br><br>But thanks to hours of aggressive practice interviews and pep talks from her best friend, Elizabeth, Gabby had been calm, composed, and in top form. The aloof Ms. Temple had been impressed with her scholastic achievements, and Gabby had gotten the distinct impression that the firm was predisposed to hire a woman (couldn&#x2019;t be too careful with those equal-opportunity statistics), which put her ahead of most of the competition. The lunch had gone swimmingly, until the moment they&#x2019;d left the restaurant and stepped out onto Fifth Street.<br><br>As Ms. Temple was extending that all-important invitation to come in for a second, in-house interview with the partners (which was never arranged unless the firm was seriously considering making an offer, joy of joys!), a sexy, muscle-bound fairy male sauntered right between them in that infuriatingly arrogant I&#x2019;m-so-perfect, don&#x2019;t-you-just-wish-you-were-me way they had, so close that its long golden hair brushed Gabby&#x2019;s cheek like a sensual ripple of silk.<br><br>The intoxicating fragrance of jasmine and sandalwood surrounded her, and the heat radiating off its powerful body caressed her like a sultry, erotic breeze. It took every ounce of her considerable self-discipline to not inch backward out of its way.<br><br>Or worse&#x2014;yield to that incessant temptation and just pet the gorgeous tawny creature. How many times had she dreamed of doing that? Copping one tiny forbidden fairy-feel. Finally finding out if all that golden fairy skin really felt as velvety as it looked. You must never betray that you can see them, Gabby.<br><br>Thoroughly discombobulated by the fairy&#x2019;s proximity, her suddenly nerveless hand lost its grip on the iced coffee she&#x2019;d taken from the restaurant in a to-go cup. It hit the sidewalk, the top flew off, and coffee exploded upward, drenching the impeccable Ms. Temple.<br><br>At that precise moment, the fairy turned back to look at her, its iridescent eyes narrowing.<br><br>Panicked, Gabby focused all her attention on the sputtering Ms. Temple. With the enthusiasm of near-hysteria, she plucked tissues from her purse and dabbed frantically at the spreading coffee stains on what had been, moments before, a pristine ivory suit that she had a sick feeling cost more than she made in a month.<br><br>Babbling loudly about how clumsy she was, apologizing and blaming everything from eating too much, to not being used to heels, to being nervous about the interview, in a matter of moments, she managed to completely blow the image of cool, composed confidence she&#x2019;d so painstakingly projected through lunch.<br><br>But she&#x2019;d had no choice.<br><br>In order to make the fairy believe she hadn&#x2019;t seen it, that she was just a clumsy human, nothing more, she&#x2019;d had to act like a complete spaz and risk sabotaging her credibility with her prospective employer.<br><br>Sabotage it, she had.<br><br>Swatting away Gabby&#x2019;s frantically dabbing hands, Ms. Temple smoothed her ruined suit and huffed off toward her car, pausing to toss stiffly over her shoulder, &#x201c;As I told you earlier, Ms. O&#x2019;Callaghan, our firm works with only the highest caliber clients. They can be demanding, excessive, and temperamental. And understandably so. When there are millions at stake, a client has every right to expect the best. We at Temple, Turley and Tucker pride ourselves on being unflappable under stress. Our clients require smooth, sophisticated handling. Frankly, Ms. O&#x2019;Callaghan, you&#x2019;re too flighty to be successful with our firm. I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;ll find an appropriate fit elsewhere. Good day, Ms. O&#x2019;Callaghan.&#x201d;<br><br>Feeling like she&#x2019;d been kicked in the stomach, Gabby watched in stricken silence as Ms. Temple accepted her spotless Mercedes from the valet, dimly registering that the fairy, blessedly, was also moving on. As the sleek pearl-colored Mercedes merged onto Fifth Street and disappeared into traffic&#x2014;the job of her dreams flapping farewell on its tailpipe&#x2014;Gabby&#x2019;s shoulders slumped. With a gusty sigh, she turned and trudged down the street to the corner lot where simple law students not-destined-for-success-because-they-were-too-flighty could afford to park.<br><br>&#x201c; &#x2018;Flighty,&#x2019; my ass,&#x201d; she muttered, resting her head on the steering wheel. &#x201c;You have no idea what my life is like. You can&#x2019;t see them.&#x201d;<br><br>All Ms. Temple had probably felt was a slight breeze, a moderate increase in temperature, perhaps caught a whiff of an exotic, arousing fragrance. And if, by chance, the fairy had brushed against her&#x2014;although they were invisible, they were real, and were actually there&#x2014;Ms. Temple would have rationalized it away somehow. Those who couldn&#x2019;t see the Fae always did.<br><br>Gabby had learned the hard way that people had zero tolerance for the inexplicable. It never ceased to amaze her what flimsy excuses they dredged up to protect their perception of reality. &#x201c;Gee, I guess I didn&#x2019;t get enough sleep last night.&#x201d; Or, &#x201c;Wow, I shouldn&#x2019;t have had that second (or third or fourth) beer with lunch.&#x201d; If all else failed, they settled for a simple &#x201c;I must have imagined it.&#x201d;<br><br>How she longed for such oblivion!<br><br>She shook her head and tried to console herself with the thought that at least the fairy had been convinced and was gone. She was safe. For now.<br><br>The way Gabby figured it, the Fae were responsible for ninety-nine percent of the problems in her life. She&#x2019;d take responsibility for the other one percent, but they were the reason her life this summer had been one crisis after another. They were the reason she&#x2019;d begun to dread leaving her house, never knowing where one might pop up, or how badly it might startle her. Or what kind of ass she&#x2019;d make of herself, trying to regroup. They were the reason her boyfriend had broken up with her fifteen days, three hours, and&#x2014;she glanced broodingly at her watch&#x2014;forty-two minutes ago.<br><br>Gabrielle O&#x2019;Callaghan harbored a special and very personal hatred for the Fae.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see you. I don&#x2019;t see you,&#x201d; she muttered beneath her breath as two mouthwatering fairy males strolled past the hood of her car. She averted her gaze, caught herself, then angled the rearview mirror and pretended to be fussing with her lipstick.<br><br>Never look away too sharply, her grandmother, Moira O&#x2019;Callaghan, had always cautioned. You must act natural. You must learn to let your gaze slide over them without either hitching or pulling away too abruptly, or they&#x2019;ll know you know. And they&#x2019;ll take you. You must never betray that you can see them. Promise me, Gabby. I can&#x2019;t lose you!<br><br>Gram had seen them, too, these creatures other people couldn&#x2019;t see. Most of the women on her mom&#x2019;s side did, though sometimes the &#x201c;gift&#x201d; skipped generations. As it had with her mom, who&#x2019;d moved to Los Angeles years ago (like the people in California were less weird than fairies), leaving then&#x2013;seven-year-old Gabrielle behind with Gram &#x201c;until she got settled.&#x201d; Jilly O&#x2019;Callaghan had never gotten settled.<br><br>Why couldn&#x2019;t it have skipped me? Gabby brooded. A normal life was all she&#x2019;d ever wanted.<br><br>And proving damned difficult to have, even in boring Cincinnati. Gabby was beginning to think that living in the Tri-State&#x2014;the geographical convergence of Indiana, Ohio, and Kentucky&#x2014;was a bit like living at the mystical convergence of Sunnydale&#x2019;s Hellmouth.<br><br>Except the Midwest didn&#x2019;t get demons and vampires&#x2014;oh, no&#x2014;they got fairies: dangerously seductive, inhuman, arrogant creatures that would take her and do God-only-knew-what to her if they ever figured out that she could see them.<br><br>Her family history was riddled with tales of ancestors who&#x2019;d been captured by the dreaded Fae Hunters and never seen again. Some of the tales claimed they were swiftly and brutally killed by the savage Hunters, others that they were forced into slavery to the Fae.<br><br>She had no idea what actually became of those foolish enough to be taken, but she knew one thing for certain: She had no intention of ever finding out.<br><br> Later Gabby would realize that it was all the cup of coffee&#x2019;s fault. Every awful thing that happened to her from that moment on could be traced directly back to that cup of coffee with the stunning simplicity of an airtight conditional argument: If not for A (said cup of coffee), then not B (blowing job interview), hence not C (having to go into work that night), and certainly not D (the horrible thing that happened to her there) . . . on to infinity.<br><br>It really wasn&#x2019;t fair that such a trivial, spur-of-the-moment, seemingly harmless decision such as taking an iced coffee to-go could change the entire course of a girl&#x2019;s life.<br><br>Not that she didn&#x2019;t hold the fairy significantly culpable, but studying law had taught her to isolate the critical catalyst so one could argue culpability, and the simple facts were that if she hadn&#x2019;t had the cup of coffee in her hand, she wouldn&#x2019;t have dropped it, wouldn&#x2019;t have splattered Ms. Temple, wouldn&#x2019;t have made an ass of herself, and wouldn&#x2019;t have lost all hope of landing her dream job.<br><br>If not for the cup of coffee, the fairy would have had no reason to turn and look back at her, and she would have had no reason to panic. Life would have rolled smoothly on. With the promise of that coveted second interview, she would have gone out celebrating with her girlfriends that night.<br><br>But because of that nefarious cup of coffee, she didn&#x2019;t go out. She went home, took a long bubble bath, had a longer cry, then later that evening, when she was certain the office would be empty and she wouldn&#x2019;t have to field humiliating questions from her fellow interns, she drove back downtown to catch up on work. She was behind by a whopping nineteen arbitration cases, which, now that she didn&#x2019;t have a different job lined up, mattered.<br><br>And because of that calamitous cup of coffee, she was in a bad mood and not paying attention as she parallel-parked in front of her office building, and she didn&#x2019;t notice the dark, dangerous-looking fairy stepping from the shadows of the adjacent alley.<br><br>If not for the stupid cup of coffee, she wouldn&#x2019;t have even been there.<br><br>And that was when things took a diabolical turn from bad to worse.</p><h2>The Music of Life (Omega Uniform Edition of the Teachings of Hazrat Inayat Khan)</h2><p>Teachings on sound presenting a vision of the harmony which underlies and infuses every aspect of life.

She was having a party and Jamie was mad because she hadn&#x2019;t invited him. When they were in high school together, she was always nice to him even though he was in special classes. But Mom had told him that it was probably just a party only for Kerry&#x2019;s classmates who would be leaving for college next week. Jamie had graduated from high school two years ago and now had a good job stocking shelves in the local Acme supermarket.<br> <br>Jamie didn&#x2019;t tell Mom that if the kids at the party started swimming in Kerry&#x2019;s pool, he was going to go over and swim with them. He knew Mom would be mad at him if he did that. But Kerry always invited him to swim in her pool when she was swimming. He watched from the window of his room until all the kids went home and Kerry was alone outside on the patio cleaning up.<br> <br>He watched the end of his video. He decided to go over and help her, even though he knew Mom would not want him to.<br> <br>He slipped downstairs, where Mom was watching the eleven o&#x2019;clock news, and tiptoed behind the hedges that separated his small backyard from Kerry&#x2019;s big one.<br> <br>But then he saw someone come into the yard from the woods. He grabbed something off a chair and came up behind Kerry, hit her on the head, and pushed her into the pool. Then he threw something away.<br> <br>You&#x2019;re not supposed to hit people or push them in pools, Jamie thought. The man should say he&#x2019;s sorry, or he might get a time-out. Kerry&#x2019;s swimming, so I can go swimming with her, he told himself.<br> <br>The man didn&#x2019;t go swimming. He ran away from the yard and back into the woods. He didn&#x2019;t go in the house. He just ran away.<br> <br>Jamie hurried toward the pool. His foot kicked something that was on the ground. It was a golf club. He picked it up, carried it toward the pool and put it on one of the chairs.<br> <br>He said, &#x201c;Kerry, it&#x2019;s Jamie. I&#x2019;ll go swimming with you now.&#x201d;<br> <br>But she didn&#x2019;t answer him. He started to walk down the pool steps. The water looked dirty. He thought maybe somebody spilled something. But when he felt the water in his new sneakers, soaking his pants up to his knees, he stopped. Even though Kerry always said he could swim with her, he knew that Mom would be mad if he got his new sneakers wet. Kerry was floating in the water. He reached out, touched her shoulder and said, &#x201c;Kerry, wake up.&#x201d; But Kerry just floated farther away, to the deep end of the pool. So he went back home.<br> <br>The news was still on the television, so Mom didn&#x2019;t see him when he sneaked back upstairs and went to bed. He knew his sneakers, socks and pants were wet, so he hid them on the floor of his closet. Maybe they&#x2019;ll dry before Mom finds them, he hoped.<br> <br>As he was falling asleep, he wondered if Kerry was having fun swimming.</p><h2>THE SEVEN MAIN ASPECTS OF GOD: The Ground Plan of the Bible</h2><p>Explains the first chapter of Genesis and gives the principles that underlie the whole Bible message.</p><p></p><h2>How to Speak Southern</h2><p><b><b>This tongue-in-cheek dictionary of Southern words and phrases offers a hilarious spoof of the Southern accent.</b><br></b> <br>This book is dedicated to all Yankees* in the hope that it will teach them how to talk right.<b>&nbsp;</b><br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>*<b>Yankee:</b>&nbsp;Anyone who is not from Kentucky, Virginia, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Arkansas, Texas, and possibly Oklahoma and West-by-God-Virginia.

Tess pleads to the sky as listless vines and parched plants droop in the endless heat. Up and down the block, cats pant while heat wavers off tar patches in the broiling alleyway. More than anything, Tess hopes for rain. And when it comes, she and her friends are ready for a surprising joyous celebration....<br>Through exquisite language and acute observation, Newbery medalist Karen Hesse recreates the glorious experience of a quenching rainstorm on a sweltering summer day. Jon J Muth's masterful and lyrical watercolors perfectly reflect the spirit of the text.</p><p>In this quietly affecting story, award-winning author Karen Hesse and artist Jon J. Muth deftly capture the magnificence of a sudden rainstorm on a swelteringly hot day. Much more than a simple tale of weather, <i>Come On, Rain!</i> also portrays the tenderness of mother-daughter relations, the rhythms of urban society, and the power of nature to transform and reinvigorate all forms of life.<p> The book's collaborators, more like alchemists, work wonders. Muth's sunbaked watercolors perfectly convey the washed-out, drought-stricken world, while Hesse's gripping narrative--a detailed prose poem written in the voice of the watchful, pigtailed Tessie--conveys undaunted hope and anticipation. Like a long-limbed little bird--all twiggy arms and legs--Tessie moves through the neighborhood, observing her Mamma, her friends, the skies, even the streets: </p><blockquote> Up and down the block,<br> cats pant,<br> heat wavers off tar patches in the broiling alleyway....<p> I stare out over rooftops,<br> past chimneys, into the way off distance.<br> And that's when I see it coming,<br> clouds rolling in,<br> gray clouds, bunched and bulging under a purple sky. </p><p> A creeper of hope circles round my bones.<br> "Come on, rain!" I whisper.<br> </p></blockquote> As the downpour approaches, Tessie gathers her neighborhood friends for a romp in the raindrops. Their eager anticipation is matched by a rain shower so gigantic, it even makes their mothers run into the street. It's literally the stuff that dreams are made of--my own daughter dreamed of the delicious downpour the night we first read the book. (Click to see a sample spread. Text �1999 by Karen Hesse.

Very few things are held sacred in this twisted, corrupt, heartless&#x2014;and oddly familiar&#x2014;universe, but the Hogfather is one of them.

And there's something shady going on involving an uncommonly psychotic member of the Assassins' Guild and certain representatives of Ankh-Morpork's rather extensive criminal element. Suddenly Discworld's entire myth system is unraveling at an alarming rate. Drastic measures must be taken, which is why Death himself is taking up the reins of the fat man's vacated sleigh . . . which, in turn, has Death's level-headed granddaughter, Susan, racing to unravel the nasty, humbuggian mess before the holiday season goes straight to hell and takes everyone along with it.<br></p></p><p>What could more genuinely embody the spirit of Christmas (or Hogswatch, on the Discworld) than a Terry Pratchett book about the holiday season? Every secular Christmas tradition is included. But as this <i>is</i> the 21st Discworld novel, there are some unusual twists. <p> This year the Auditors, who want people to stop believing in things that aren't real, have hired an assassin to eliminate the Hogfather. (You know him: red robe, white beard, says, "Ho, ho, ho!") Their evil plot will destroy the Discworld unless someone covers for him. So someone does. Well, at least Death <i>tries</i>. He wears the costume and rides the sleigh drawn by four jolly pigs: Gouger, Tusker, Rooter, and Snouter. He even comes down chimneys. But as fans of other Pratchett stories about Death (<i>Mort</i>, <i>Reaper Man</i>, and <i>Soul Music</i>) know, he takes things literally. He gives children whatever they wish for and appears in person at Crumley's in The Maul. </p><p> Fans will welcome back Susan, Death of Rats (the Grim Squeaker), Albert, and the wizardly faculty of Unseen University, and revel in new personalities like Bilious, the "oh god of Hangovers." But you needn't have read Pratchett before to laugh uproariously and think seriously about the meanings of Christmas. <i>--Nona Vero</i></p>"Has the energy of "The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy and the inventiveness of <i>Alice in Wonderland...</i>It has also an intelligent wit and a truly original grim and comic grasp of the nature of things." <br>-A.S.

Parents and caregivers struggle with these little ones, who are known for their extreme behaviour, from tantrums, resistance, and aggression to separation anxiety, bedtime protests, and not listening. The key to understanding youngsters lies in realizing that their challenging behaviour is not personal, nor is it a disorder or deficit. Based on science and the relational developmental approach of renowned psychologist and bestselling author Gordon Neufeld, <i>Rest, Play, Grow</i> reveals how critical adults are in shaping the conditions to ensure young children flourish. This is the story of how young children develop, from their intense need for attachment and the vital importance of play to discipline that preserves growth. Engagingly written, with compassion for its subjects and rich with stories from them and their parents, Rest, Play, Grow will forever change the way you think of the preschoolers in your life.</p><p>Dr. Deborah MacNamara is a clinical counsellor and educator with more than twenty-five years experience working with children, youth, and adults.

The assignments first given to Scarry tended to be Little Golden Books that featured popular characters of the day, such as Winky Dink, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, and Smokey the Bear. Eventually, Scarry created his own original characters, such as Lowly Worm and Huckle Cat. But first came Nicholas, a young rabbit clad in red overalls, for the now-iconic classic&nbsp;<i>I Am a Bunny</i>. <br><br>In his extraordinary career, Richard Scarry illustrated more than 150 books, many of which have never been out of print.

Fresh from his training by MI6, Alex Rider is headed for an exclusive private school in the French Alps because the isolated mountain academy is linked to the deaths of two prominent men. Just like 007, Alex is equipped with special gear such as an exploding stud earring and a CD that doubles as a buzz saw. Though Alex finds himself in a few tight spots, his courage and ingenuity prevent the school's power-mad directors from using adolescent clones to take over the world. Author Anthony Horowitz packs plenty of action into his latest young adult thriller (Philomel, 2002). An exploding helicopter, a machine gunning strike force, and other shootings provide standard superspy-style violence. There's even the classic Bond ending with a last-minute villain to be dispatched. Narrator Simon Prebble adroitly handles a widely diverse cast of characters that includes several distinctive accents. With a plastic case that is both durable and informative, and good sound quality cassettes that are well-marked, this will be popular with listeners who like living on the edge vicariously.<br><i>Barbara Wysocki, Cora J.

So how to explain those Japanese death matches in rings with explosives, golden thumbtacks and barbed wire instead of rope? The second-degree burn tissue? And the missing ear that was ripped off during a bout-in which he kept fighting? Here is an intimate glimpse into Mick Foley's mind, his history, his work and what some might call his pathology. Now with a bonus chapter summarizing the past 15 months-from his experience as a bestselling author through his parting thoughts before his final match. A tale of blood, sweat, tears and more blood-all in his own words-straight from the twisted genius behind Cactus Jack, Dude Love, and Mankind.</p></p><p>Frankly, this literary critic didn't expect Mick Foley's memoir of his life as Mankind (and his other wrestling personas, Cactus Jack and Dude Love) to hit No. 1 on Amazon.com's hardcover nonfiction bestseller list in its first literary bout. The cover is cluttered and confusing, and do we really need 500-plus pages of Foley's boasts? Yes. Foley gives his all for his calling, and he burns to tell his adventures. Take the famous tale of how he lost most of his ear (the bloody result is depicted in the 16-page color-photo section). It was in his 1994 bouts with Vader (Leon White): after getting a broken nose, a dislocated jaw, and 21 stitches in the first match, Foley did his "hangman" routine, wherein he catches his neck between the second and third ropes and spins them into a twist. "The end result is the illusion of a man being hanged by his neck while his body kicks and writhes in an attempt to get out... the man actually <i>is</i> hanging by his neck and the body really <i>does</i> kick and writhe in an attempt to get out." Unfortunately, in the prior match, Too Cold Scorpio had had the officials tighten the ropes, so Foley tore off his ear to avoid death by strangulation, like "a fox that chews off its paw to escape a trap." Foley also wrestles on 10,000-thumbtack mats with barbwire ropes and C-4 explosives, and earns the ultimate compliment: "The fans really like the way you bleed." Many fans also like the way his gory story reads. <i>--Tim Appelo</i>This book is not for the squeamish. No. This is the autobiography of the Hardcore Legend, Mick Foley. Some wrestling fans claim that "Foley is God." You're about to find out why.<p> Mick Foley is a nice man. A family man. He loves his son, Dewey, his daughter, Noelle, and his beautiful wife, Colette. He loves amusement parks, eating ice cream in bed, and watching Nickelodeon.</p><p> So, how to explain his participation in Japanese Death Matches, which replace the ring ropes with barbed wire, cover the mats with glittering gold thumbtacks, and feature C4 explosives scattered throughout the ring? How to explain the barbed-wire scars that zigzag across his body, the second-degree burn tissue that is a memento of an exploding C4, and the missing ear that was ripped clean off his head during a bout? And how to explain how, after losing his ear, he then continued his match?</p><p> Here is an intimate glimpse into Mick Foley's mind, his history, his passions, and what some might call his pathology. No ghostwriter. Not "as told to." Straight from the twisted genius behind Cactus Jack, Dude Love, and Mankind--deciphered from 760 pages of maniacally handwritten notebook paper--comes a tale of blood, sweat, tears, and still more blood.</p><p> You'll chuckle at Mick's early backyard wrestling antics and homemade wrestling movies. You'll be amazed by the inside scoop on legends in the business like Terry Funk, Harley Race, Abdullah the Butcher, and Ric Flair. You'll squirm as Mick describes his incredible risks in the ring and his grisly, mind-numbing injuries. Finally, you will cheer with true admiration as arguably the hardest-working, most dedicated, and most heroic man in sports-entertainment beats all the odds and takes home the prize he had been told all along he would never, ever get: the World Wrestling Federation Championship belt.</p></p><h2>The Colonel: The Extraordinary Story of Colonel Tom Parker and Elvis Presley</h2><p>In <i>The Colonel</i>, Alanna Nash, the author of <i>Golden Girl: The Story of Jessica Savitch</i>, explores in depth the amazing story of Colonel Tom Parker, the man behind the legend and the myth of Elvis Presley. The result is a book that reads like the most riveting of real-life detective stories -- one that will completely change your view of Presley's life, success, and death.<br><br>While scores of books have been written about Elvis Presley, this is the first meticulously researched biography of Tom Parker written by someone who knew him personally. And for anyone truly interested in the performer many consider the greatest and most influential of the twentieth century, it is impossible to understand how Elvis came to be such a phenomenon without examining the life and mind of Parker, the man who virtually controlled Elvis's every move.<br><br>Alanna Nash has been covering the story of Elvis Presley and Colonel Tom Parker since the day of Presley's funeral in Memphis, Tennessee. She was the first journalist allowed to view Presley's body, a compelling and surprising sight. But the profile of Parker attending the funeral in a Hawaiian shirt and a baseball cap was even stranger, and led her to investigate the man behind the myth.<br><br>It has been known for twenty years that Thomas Andrew Parker was, in fact, born in Holland as Andreas Cornelis van Kuijk. But Nash has dug much deeper and, in a masterpiece of reporting, unearthed never-before-seen documents, including Parker's army records and psychiatric evaluations, and the original police report of an unsolved murder case in Holland that lies at the heart of the Parker mystery. In the process of weighing the evidence, she answers the biggest riddle in the history of the music industry, as it becomes clear that every move Parker made in the handling of Elvis Presley -- from why he never allowed Elvis to perform in Europe, to why he didn't halt Elvis's drug use, to why he put him in so many mediocre movies, and even the Colonel's direction of Presley's army career -- was designed to protect Parker's own secrets. <br><br>Filled with startling new material, her book challenges even the most familiar precepts of the Presley saga -- everything we presumed about Parker's handling of the world's most famous entertainer must now be reevaluated in the light of information Nash reveals about Parker, who cared little for Presley beyond what the singer could do to bolster the Colonel's precarious position as an illegal alien.<br><br>Elvis Presley, as one of Parker's unwitting victims, paid a major price for the Colonel's past and his overwhelming need to be more important than his client. As a result, Presley was never allowed to reach his potential and died in drug-induced frustration over his stunted and mismanaged career.<br><br>In this astonishing, impeccably written, and vastly entertaining book, Nash proves that the only figure in American popular culture as fascinating as Elvis Presley is Colonel Tom Parker, the man who shaped Elvis, who in turn helped shape us.</p><p>A feature writer for <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>, <i>USA Weekend</i>, and <i>The New York Times</i>, <b>Alanna Nash</b> is a longtime chronicler of popular culture. She is the author of five books, including <i>Elvis Aaron Presley: Revelations from the Memphis Mafia</i> and <i>Golden Girl: The Story of Jessica Savitch</i>, which was the basis for the feature film <i>Up Close and Personal</i>.

Please visit the author's website: www.colonelparker.com<b>Introduction</b><br><br>"Did you see it?" the old man asked, shifting his mountainous heap of flesh to the edge of the chair, his eyes open wide and twinkling. "What a hell of a thing! Unbelievable!"<br><br>It was June 18, 1994, the day after O. J. Simpson's infamous Bronco run, and Colonel Tom Parker, with his attentive wife, Loanne, at his side, held court for two visitors at the N'Orleans Restaurant, a meat 'n' two joint in a run-of-the-mill strip mall named Lucky's on the outskirts of the gambling capital of the world.<br><br>Like the rest of the country, Parker had been mesmerized by Simpson's bizarre highway chase. But now his reaction, with his face momentarily frozen in awe, spoke silently of something else -- not of a fascination with sports or the subtleties of race relations, but of a sort of perverse pride, perhaps, in an elite and remarkable fraternity of rogues. Or at the very least, in a man who had taken a terrible risk, and managed to beat the odds.<br><br>This was my second of three visits with Parker, whose own survivor instincts so defied description that many thought him indestructible. Yet less than three years later, also in Vegas, far from his birthplace of Breda, Holland, where he first learned the art of the hustle as an errand boy in Dutch fairs, circuses, and carnivals, he succumbed to the complications of a stroke at the age of eighty-seven.<br><br>A master illusionist in business and in the business of life, Tom Parker made things appear and disappear at will, and created something very great out of nothing -- including himself. Out of respect for that, if nothing else, I went back to say good-bye.<br><br>��<br><br>The giant marquee outside the Las Vegas Hilton was both sweet and succinct (FAREWELL, COLONEL PARKER), but not everybody knew what it meant.<br><br>"You here to gamble?" asked my taxi driver, who had shuttled me in from the airport on a late January day in 1997 and who had uttered not a word until tip time.<br><br>"No, I'm going to the memorial service for Colonel Parker."<br><br>A beat. "Dat the fried chicken guy?"<br><br>At least one cynical obituary writer, Serene Dominic, seconded that thought in a <i>Phoenix New Times</i> article headed "Cooked the Colonel's Way -- Colonel Tom Parker Has Kicked the Bucket, and the Original Recipe for Rock 'n' Roll Rotisserie Goes with Him." But the 160 mourners who filtered into Ballroom D saw him as one of the last giants and true iconoclasts of the century -- a penniless immigrant who slipped into the country, befriended U.S. presidents and corporate CEOs, created both an icon and a $4-billion business, and never let any of it get in the way of what mattered most -- playing the game.<br><br>Through it all, he remained as individualistic, as shrewd, rude, crude, and fun-loving as ever. At his death, he still delighted in practicing what he called the art of "snowing," the exquisitely performed act of separating people from their money, leaving them with a smile on their face and melting away before they realized what had taken place.<br><br>While some would argue that Parker's very body was a temple to gluttony, greed, and feeding off the dimmer wits of others, it was the Snowman his friends had come to honor this day, his widow, Loanne, posing an intriguing question.<br><br>"I want to leave you with just one thought," she said, addressing the crowd, which had passed a lobby-card-size photo of the couple at the entrance. "If Thomas A. Parker had never existed, how would each of your lives be different today?"<br><br>One person who couldn't answer that question was Elvis Aaron Presley, whose piped-in versions of "Memories" and "How Great Thou Art" opened and closed the service with ghostly reverence. The Elvis Presley who had first come to Vegas in 1956 as an acne-faced adolescent left it twenty years later as a pathetic, corseted cartoon, his body blown from years of abuse, his spirit picked hollow.<br><br>For all of the twenty years that Parker outlasted his greatest discovery, he would also have to live with the allegations that he had destroyed him, stifling his artistry in third-rate Hollywood formula pictures, suffocating his ambition in 837 Vegas performances from 1969 to 1976, and killing his will to live by refusing to challenge him in meaningful ways -- a European tour, a dramatic film role to reclaim his self-respect, a crack at a memorable song.<br><br>Whether regarded as a meretricious and evil confidence man, or as a brilliant marketer and strategist, as remarkable as the star he managed, no figure in all of entertainment is more controversial, colorful, or larger than life than Tom Parker. "He was so immense, so gigantic in his way," remembers writer Robert Kotlowitz, an RCA publicist in the late '50s and early '60s. "His style was equivalent to a great politician's, with so much flamboyance and wit and, underneath it all, cunning. He had to beat the whole world."<br><br>Yet at his death, Parker was blasted by rock critic Dave Marsh as "the most overrated person in the history of show business," and assessed by Dutch journalist and filmmaker Constant Meijers as "a nobody who needed a somebody to be anybody." To this day, a favorite debate question among pop music journalists is whether Elvis, whom the Colonel often referred to in carnival terms as "my attraction," would have remained a regional act without Parker's guidance, or if the young performer was such a blazing comet that no one could have stopped his streak across the sky.<br><br>The probability is that neither man would have been as big in his field without the other, Parker realizing, like P. T. Barnum, that the promotion of a curiosity was just as important as the curiosity itself. A chameleon who was many things to many people, Parker has his staunch defenders -- as a visionary, a businessman, and a friend, even by those who got up from the losing side of the bargaining table. And while Parker probably would have referred to himself as a promoter more than anything else, having marketed the icon most recognizable in all the world after Coca-Cola, Chet Atkins, who dealt with many of the biggest artists during his tenure as an RCA Records executive, pronounced Parker "the best manager I ever saw....Whatever he cost Elvis, he was worth it, because Elvis would've...lost that luster in no time if it hadn't been for the Colonel."<br><br>Mike Crowley, who traveled with Parker in the concert years of the '70s and is now a talent manager himself, speaks, like many, of Parker's loyalty, and also justifies his treatment of Elvis, the addict. "Nobody killed Elvis except Elvis, and nobody could have helped Elvis but Elvis. The only other thing he could have done was walk away."<br><br>Parker himself never bothered to address his critics, nor did he try to carve out much middle ground in the debate of whether he was the devil or angel in Elvis's own private hell. When pressed about his handling or mishandling of Elvis, he'd merely bristle, stamp his cane into the ground, and repeat his stock answer: "I sleep good at night."<br><br>Beyond that, the old Dutchman who understood America far better than most Americans simply threw out the line he'd used for decades to keep himself out of headlines ("Elvis is my only client and my life, so I never give out stories about myself"), allegedly because he was writing a memoir to be called <i>How Much Does It Cost If It's Free?</i> But it was an excuse he had concocted to keep others from looking too closely at the hocus-pocus of his life, and from having to explain himself, especially in light of a 1980 lawsuit in which the state of Tennessee accused him of "overreaching" in his fiduciary responsibilities to Presley.<br><br>If Elvis was unknowable by his manager's design, the Colonel was beyond knowing, even to his own family. In 1980, Parker's brother-in-law, Bitsy Mott, who spent many years on the road in the Colonel's employ, was asked to explain the man he'd known for nearly half a century. "That man's a mystery," he said, and little more, for not even he knew that Parker had a secret to protect, a secret that colored nearly everything he did.<br><br>On the surface, it would appear only that Parker had entered the country illegally and had never become a naturalized U.S. citizen. But if something darker had happened in the distant Netherlands, it must have been deep, shameful, and nearly unforgivable, at least to Parker himself. Certainly he never talked about it, or about his Dutch upbringing, to either Presley or any of his previous clients. And when the Colonel's stepson, Bobby Ross, died in 1978, it was without benefit of the knowledge that the man who had reared him from the age of ten had not been born as Thomas Andrew Parker in Huntington, West Virginia, as he always claimed, but as Andreas Cornelis van Kuijk -- known as Andre to his Dutch biological family.<br><br>I first met Colonel Parker in December 1992, and I wondered then how the secret of his origins -- revealed to the world at large in 1981 -- impacted the all-dominating decisions he made in shaping nearly every event in the life and career of Elvis Presley.<br><br>At first glance, Presley and Parker appeared to have little in common except the raging fire of ambition, shaped by a shameless ferocity both struggled to keep hidden. Yet I discovered as I began to research this book that in the strange choreography of chance and coincidence, the fates of Elvis Aaron Presley and Thomas Andrew Parker were bound by two still surging events, and the pull each incident had on both of them.<br><br>Despite the hundreds of books profiling Presley and his career, the story of the relationship between these men, I saw, had yet to be uncovered. Parker was a man of not just one, but many secrets, and the keeper of several fantastic tales he fought to preserve, with Elvis almost always paying too much of the price.<br><br>On each of my three visits with Colonel Parker, I sat across the table from him and looked into his eyes -- hypnotic pools of unearthly blue -- and wondered, Just who <i>are</i> you?<br><br>And so I decided to research the story chronologically, trying to find the boy who became the man. That mission took me to Holland, where I met with the kindest and most cooperative sources on this book: Parker's Dutch family, who were as mystified by his behavior and as dedicated to finding the truth as I was.<br><br>Over a period of three years, I interviewed and corresponded with several members of the van Kuijk clan, including the Colonel's ninety-two-year-old sister, Marie. And with the help of American journalist Bill Burk, I established an ongoing and treasured friendship with Parker's niece, Mieke Dons-Maas, who worked so hard in the 1990s to try to reunite her mother, Engelina, with her brother in America. Along with her husband, Ted, and friends Angelo Somers and Hanneke Neutkens, who spent years gathering materials for a proposed Parker foundation, we united as a team, chasing the apparition of a lad who had walked the Breda streets so long ago on the first leg of his remarkable journey.<br><br>In the end, my research led me to realize that the tale of Colonel Thomas Andrew Parker, n� Andreas Cornelis van Kuijk, is, beneath the veil of secrecy, a tragedy, and very nearly the stuff of Shakespeare.<br><br>The following is my attempt to resolve the conundrum of his life.<br><br> -- <i>Alanna Nash</i><br><br>Copyright � 2003 by Alanna Nash</p><h2>Our Dreams at Dusk: Shimanami Tasogare Vol. 1</h2><p><p><b>The Harvey-nominated manga about a broad LGBT+ community.</b></p><p>Not only is high schooler Tasuku Kaname the new kid in town, he is also terrified that he has been outed as gay.

When we choose retreat, we make a generous investment in our friendship with Christ. We are not always generous with ourselves where God is concerned. Many of us have tried to incorporate regular times of solitude and silence into the rhythm of our ordinary lives, which may mean that we give God twenty minutes here and half an hour there. And there&#x2019;s no question we are better for it! But we need more. Indeed, we long for more. In these pages Transforming Center founder and seasoned spiritual director Ruth Haley Barton gently leads us into retreat as a key practice that opens us to God. Based on her own practice and her experience leading hundreds of retreats for others, she will guide you in a very personal exploration of seven specific invitations contained within the general invitation to retreat. You will discover how to say yes to God's winsome invitation to greater freedom and surrender. There has never been a time when the invitation to retreat is so radical and so relevant, so needed and so welcome. It is not a luxury, but a necessity of the spiritual life.</p><p>Ruth Haley Barton (Doctor of Divinity, Northern Seminary) is founding president/CEO of the Transforming Center, a ministry dedicated to strengthening the souls of pastors and Christian leaders, and the congregations and organizations they serve. For over twenty years, she has ministered to the soul care needs of pastors and leaders based upon her conviction that the best thing we bring to leadership is our own transforming selves. Trained at the Shalem Institute for Spiritual Formation and the Institute for Pastoral Studies Loyola University Chicago, Ruth is a seasoned retreat leader and spiritual director. A sought-after speaker and preacher, she has served on the pastoral staff of several churches and teaches frequently at seminaries and graduate schools. Ruth is the author of numerous books and resources on the spiritual life, including <em>Invitation to Solitude and Silence</em>, <em>Sacred Rhythms</em>, <em>Longing for More</em>, <em>Pursuing God's Will Together</em>, and <em>Life Together in Christ</em>. She continues to share her thoughts and perspectives on soulful leadership through an online resource called <em>eReflections</em> as well as a podcast entitled <em>Strengthening the Soul of Your Leadership</em>."I have had the privilege of being on retreat with Ruth as she led with a passion and patience that refueled us weary travelers on the faith journey. If you are desperate to meet God, start with this book. <em>Invitation to Retreat</em> forced me to accept a truth all Christians must grapple with: unless we retreat into solitude and silence to be alone with our God, we will never have a real relationship with him. We will spend our lives believing we have a relationship because we go to church, hear about God from others, read and study about God, even hang theological diplomas on our walls. Yet even then, we may not <em>know</em> him. This book is an invitation into the process and the practice of building intentional rhythms into this busy life of ours&#x2015;to simply be with the One who loved us first and <em>actually have</em> a relationship with God." (Ricky Staub, founder of Neighborhood Film Company)<br><br>"A wise new guide to retreat, dealing not just with practical questions on how but the even more significant why. Ruth Haley Barton reminds us we need to pause, rest, relent, and let God take charge. She mentions many guides and wisdom figures, but the best is God's Spirit working in us when we let go. I was struck by her final chapter about coming back from retreat strengthened to bless others who need our counsel. <em>Invitation to Retreat</em> is powerful." (Emilie Griffin, author of Wilderness Time and Doors into Prayer)<br><br>"Early on in Ruth Haley Barton's <em>Invitation to Retreat</em>, she levels the chilling diagnosis: 'If we are honest, many of us have given up hope that we will ever be rested.' Far from hopeless, however, Ruth lays out the comprehensive antidote. From her insightful analysis of just what is making us so tired, to her incredibly inviting description of 'strategic withdrawal,' to the copious practical retreat materials and suggestions, this book might be the first thing you pack for your next retreat. Like a consummate wilderness guide, Ruth paints an enticing picture of the destination then patiently leads us every step of the way." (Jim Martin, vice president of spiritual formation at International Justice Mission, author of The Just Church)<br><br>"Ruth is one of single greatest gifts God has brought into my life, and I believe she is a prophetic voice bringing healing and hope to pastors and leaders that are desperate to find rest. Ruth speaks from a deep and authentic well. She has done her own work in creating rhythms of rest that relinquish control, respond to the voice of God, and recalibrate life so she is healthy and whole. You hold in your hands one of the most impactful books I have read." (Jeanne Stevens, lead pastor at Soul City Church)<br><br>"I have had the great privilege of attending retreats led by Ruth Haley Barton on more than a dozen occasions. Because she knows the demands of ministry firsthand, her invitation for pastors and leaders to retreat is an urgent one, with a singular focus: to have a fresh encounter with God for our own soul's sake. <em>Invitation to Retreat</em> lays a foundation for the necessity of retreat, but it also serves as a guide for those who have the courage to accept the invitation itself." (Steve Wiens, author of Beginnings, and senior pastor of Genesis Covenant Church in Robbinsdale, MN)<br><br>"This book offers practical guidance and astonishing insight into the physical, psychological, and spiritual dynamics of intentional solitude. Thank you, Ruth Haley Barton, for sharing your well-earned wisdom about listening to the heart of the Creator and the authentic self." (Mark Scandrette, founding director of ReIMAGINE, coauthor of Free and Belonging and Becoming)<br><br>"Many years ago when I was just a few years into ministry, I took my first spiritual retreat. I didn't know what to expect, and I didn't know what to do. But more than that I didn't know how desperately I needed it. Ruth led the retreat. Since that first retreat to this very day, Ruth has been a friend, mentor, and advocate for my soul. She has invited me and led me time and again to places of rest, replenishment, and retreat.<br><br>This book is the embodiment of how she lives and leads. It is an echo of the invitation given by Jesus to simply 'come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest.' You need this book more than you know. Trust me. You do. And if you are willing to say yes to this invitation to retreat, I believe you will find a burden that is far lighter than you have made it and a Savior who is far closer than you imagined." (Jarrett Stevens, copastor of Soul City Church, author of Four Small Words)<br><br>"I have been taking retreats for most of my adult life&#x2015;how I wish I had this book long ago to guide me! Ruth provides practical ways to make our time alone with God much more intentional and ultimately more life giving. After I put the book down, I was ready to schedule a retreat armed with a whole new perspective and plan." (Nancy Beach, leadership coach with Slingshot Group, author of Gifted to Lead: The Art of Leading as a Woman in the Church)<br><br>"When Ruth Haley Barton shared her new manuscript with me for <em>Invitation to Retreat</em>, I knew it would prove to be another powerful tool to enjoy and experience the presence of God. However, I was unprepared for such practical, honest, and open insights into the spiritual discipline of retreat. If we're serious about true spiritual transformation, I would encourage all of us to explore God's invitation to get away, rest, and reflect through the pages of this book." (Santiago "Jimmy" Mellado, president and CEO, Compassion International)<br><br>"<em>Invitation to Retreat</em> paints an alluring picture of what a retreat can really be: a generous use of time, a way to savor rest, or a space to hear God more clearly. Barton's book provides the permission and understanding that are needed to revel in the spacious practice of retreat."

After finishing his studies at the Art Student League and the New York School of Industrial Design, Mr. Galdone worked in the art department of a major publishing house. There he was introduced to the process of bookmaking, an activity that was soon to become his lifelong career. Before his death in 1986, Mr. Galdone illustrated almost three hundred books, many of which he himself wrote or retold. He is fondly remembered for his contemporary style, bright earthy humor, and action-filled illustrations, which will continue to delight for generations to come.</p>PreSchool-Grade 2 Only the familiar plot of this well-known Norwegian folktale is recognizable in this revision. Gone is the cadence and beauty of G. W. Dasent's translation of Asbjornsen and Moe's text, found in Marcia Brown's version (HBJ, 1957; o.p.). Instead there is language devoid of rhythm and mystery. In addition, unnecessary motivations are ascribed to the characters that serve to explain the reason for their violent actions (the troll is hungry; the big Billy Goat Gruff is angry). These explanations serve only to dilute the power of the story. The full-color illustrations are humorous; the goats walk about on their hind legs, the smallest goat wears a diaper and sucks a pacifier, and the biggest wears a black leather jacket, to reinforce the point that he is tough enough to destroy the troll. The troll is quite scary, and although he does have a nose as long as a poker, his eyes are not as big as saucers; the illustration that introduces the troll does not even show his eyes. A better purchase is Galdone's version (Clarion, 1981) which is well-suited for use with large groups and more closely follows the standard translation.

She lives with her husband in Brookline, Massachusetts.Kindergarten-Grade 2. A whimsical tale in which an old Eskimo-Inuit woman adopts an orphan polar bear cub that provides food for her as it grows up. When the men of the village grow jealous of the animal's superior hunting ability and decide to kill it, she sends it away. For years afterward, she walks far out on the ice and meets the bear, who brings her salmon and seal. The story gives a picture of motherly love toward an "adopted child," one the woman will love always. "Little Bear," a selection in The Dancing Fox (Morrow, 1997), edited by John Bierhorst, is a similar tale, but the villains in that retelling are neighboring villagers who threaten to kill the bear since it is catching their food sources, and the woman and bear are never reunited. Thus, Polar Bear Son has a more satisfying ending. Illustrated in muted pastel colors, the pictures capture this stark, yet beautiful, winter world. The clothing styles are of Greenland Inuit but the landscape could be anywhere in the Arctic. The author gives explanations about the background and her research into Inuit tales. A heartwarming selection to fill requests for multicultural picture books and/or books on this region.?Mollie Bynum, formerly at Chester Valley Elementary School, Anchorage, AK<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Days on the Road: Crossing the Plains in 1865</h2><p>Sarah Raymond was an unmarried woman of twenty-four who in May 1865--barely a month after the end of the Civil War--mounted her beloved pony and headed west alongside the wagon carrying her mother and two younger brothers.

She lives in New York City. Visit her at www.tayannahmcquillar.com.Chapter 1: <b>What Is Rootwork?</b><br><br>Rootwork is a form of folk magick that uses the elements of nature to create change in ourselves, others, or our environment. It is an African-American form of shamanism that makes use of herbs, stones, rocks, and other organic material to heal the body or the mind, or to solve a problem. Like all other forms of shamanism, Rootworkers believe that we can use the unseen forces of nature to manipulate the tangible world.<br><br>Rootwork is also known as "Hoodoo" in the southern part of the United States. The word <i>Hoodoo</i> is probably derived from the word <i>juju,</i> an African word meaning "magic," or from Voodoo, a corrupted version of the Fon word <i>Vodun,</i> meaning "spirit" or "god." But unlike Vodun, Lukumi, Candomble, Shango, Batque, etc., Rootwork is not a religion. It has no pantheon or priesthood. It refers only to a set of healing and spell practices, and the practitioner can be whatever religion they wish. The theology behind the spells has been lost, thus there are no formal initiations to become a Rootworker. However, a good practitioner is traditionally referred to as Doctor, Mother, Uncle, or Aunt out of respect for their vast problem-solving knowledge.<br><br>Prior to the great migration of blacks to urban cities, these shamans were equally feared and respected, and usually lived away from the "regular folks" and made a profitable business off people who would sneak to see them under the cloak of darkness for help in resolving their issues. Most people lived by the saying "You want salvation, go to church. You want something done, go to the Rootworker."<br><br>Rootwork also served a practical purpose in the black community. Many Africans had experience working with herbs in their homeland and transmitted their botanical knowledge to their children. This information was passed on orally and was used to cure the sick and ailing. The most common afflictions Rootworkers treated were smallpox and digestive disorders, by boiling down the roots of certain herbs like the spikenard (hyptis suaveolens) or the sensitive plant (mimosa pudica) and making a tonic for their clients to drink.<br><br>All blacks in the South had to know basic healing techniques because traditional health care was too expensive for slaves to afford. In fact, many whites couldn't afford a traditional doctor either, and would often turn to their slaves' botanical knowledge for cures.<br><br><b>Native Americans and Rootwork</b><br><br>African slaves would often seek refuge among Native Americans because they had a similar worldview and they were willing to teach them how to survive in the New World. Although Africans were knowledgeable about African plants and their uses, they had no idea what to do with the herbs found in this strange land. Native Americans taught them the properties of local herbs and roots. The depiction of Native American chiefs and warriors on the packages of many "luck drawing" floor washes are testimony to the impact Native Americans had on rootwork.<br><br>These floor washes are simply a combination of water mixed with different perfumes and contain no herbs or roots at all. Most people don't read the ingredients in these products but just assume their effectiveness because of the clever packaging. Certainly if there is an image of a Native American on it, the product must be "magical," right? When, in fact, it's about as magical as Mop-n-Glow.<br><br><b>Rootwork Today</b><br><br>When African Americans migrated north, many left Rootwork behind. They were seeking better opportunities and a more sophisticated way of living, and Rootwork was considered "backward" or "country" and was frowned upon. This theme was dealt with in Julie Dash's cinematic masterpiece, <i>Daughters of the Dust.</i><br><br>As standard medical care became more available, fewer people had need for the Rootworkers. But many still consulted them to perform divination or spell work.<br><br>Today, because of miseducation and the media's negative portrayal of any spiritual system based in Africa, most people avoid Rootwork. Everything that is African is feared, ignored, and rejected because of a deep and painful history of erasure of Africa as a major contributor to world culture. Even with the vast knowledge accumulated in the last century, when most people think of African spirituality and its practices in the New World, the mind usually conjures up images of spooky witchdoctors, bloody cannibalistic rituals, and evil curses. The media still transmits this propaganda through cartoons and movies, especially in the horror genre such as <i>The Serpent and the Rainbow, Child's Play, Voodoo Dawn,</i> and <i>Tales from the Crypt</i> to name a few.<br>A case in point is Webster's dictionary definition of <i>Hoodoo:</i><br><br><i>Hoodoo: 1. voodoo 2. bad luck 3. A person or thing that brings bad luck.</i><br><br>Inaccuracies such as this pervade our culture, resulting not only in a negative psychological effect on African Americans and others in the Diaspora, but also in preventing others from understanding the true nature of these practices. This book is an attempt to correct these inaccuracies by placing Rootwork in its proper historical, cultural, and spiritual context.<br><br>Copyright � 2003 by Tayannah McQuillar</p><h2>Forever Young</h2><p><b>WINNER OF THE NOBEL PRIZE IN LITERATURE</b><br> <br><b>The classic anthem to youth from Bob Dylan, one of our best-loved songwriters, reimagined as a picture book by award-winning illustrator Paul Rogers.</b><br><br>Since it first appeared on the 1974 album <i>Planet Waves</i>, "Forever Young" has been one of Bob Dylan's most beloved songs. Now award-winning artist Paul Rogers gives us a new interpretation of the lyrics. With images inspired by classic Dylan songs and pieces of his life, this is a bold and touching tribute to an anthem whose message will always stay forever young.</p><p>Bob Dylan has released thirty-eight studio albums, which collectively have sold over 120 million copies around the world. He won the Nobel Prize in Literature and has been awarded the French Legion of Honor, a Pulitzer Prize Special Citation, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the country&#x2019;s highest civilian honor. His memoir,&nbsp;<i>Chronicles: Volume One</i>, spent a year on the&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>bestseller list.<br><br>Paul Rogers is the illustrator of Wynton Marsalis's book <i>Jazz ABZ</i>. In addition to illustrating children's books, he has created images for the <i>New York Times</i>, Pixar Animation Studios, the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival, and the NFL's Super Bowl. He lives with his wife, Jill, and his two children, Alex and Nate, in Pasadena, California.Kindergarten-Grade 4&#x2014;Rogers has fashioned Dylan's 1973 song into an homage to the musician and to coming of age in the 1960s. Adults familiar with the songwriter's life and albums will recognize images in the artwork that recall the period. For those who miss these references, a page-by-page explanation of the visual clues is appended. Most children will feel that the text reads like a blessing spoken by an adult to a growing boy. The illustrations show a street musician giving his guitar to a Caucasian child. He learns to play it and becomes friends with an African-American boy. The two eventually form their own street band, travel the country in a VW bug, and participate in rallies to save the planet and stop the war. The story comes full circle as the young man passes his guitar on to a girl at song's end. Some of the images will be confusing to those who don't read the back matter; e.g., the sticker on the guitar case that reads, "This machine kills Fascists" is a Woody Guthrie reference. A pleasant but additional purchase that will give baby boomers an opportunity to wax nostalgic about "the good old days" with their grandkids.&#x2014;<i>Martha Simpson, Stratford Library Association, CT</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The rumble of war with the British grows louder each day, and spies for and against the Patriots are everywhere. No one is above suspicion. Still, everyday life must go on and young Maddy Rose must help her mother, especially since her father&#39;s death at the Battle of Princeton and now with her beloved brother Jonathan off with Washington&#39;s army. But when childhood games become life-and-death actions, Maddy Rose is drawn ever deeper into events that will explode beyond her imagining. As young America stands on the very brink of its fight for freedom, it becomes clear that even the smallest of citizens can play the largest of parts, and that the role of a patriot has nothing to do with age and everything to do with heart. In The Scarlet Stockings Spy, Trinka Hakes Noble melds a suspenseful tale of devotion, sacrifice, and patriotism with the stark realities of our country&#39;s birth.Noted picture book author and illustrator Trinka Hakes Noble has pursued the study of children&#39;s book writing and illustrating in New York City at Parsons School of Design, the New School University, Caldecott medalist Uri Shulevitz&#39;s Greenwich Village Workshop, and New York University. She has authored and illustrated numerous books including the popular Jimmy&#39;s Boa series, which has been translated into six languages. Trinka lives in Berrnardsville, New Jersey. The Scarlet Stockings Spy is her first book with Sleeping Bear Press. Because Robert Papp&#39;s childhood drawings of his favorite superheros were such a pleasure, it was only natural that he would wind up an illustrator. Nowadays, his award-winning artwork appears on book covers and in magazines instead of on the refrigerator. He has produced hundreds of cover illustrations for major publishers across the United States. Robert lives in historic Bucks County, Pennsylvania.</p><p>Trinka Hakes Noble is the award-winning author of numerous picture books including The Orange Shoes (2007 National Parenting Publications Awards Honors Winner), The Scarlet Stockings Spy (2005 IRA Teachers&#39; Choice), The Last Brother, and The Legend of the Cape May Diamond. Ms. Noble also wrote the ever-popular Jimmy&#39;s Boa series and Meanwhile Back at the Ranch, both featured on PBS&#39;s Reading Rainbow. Her many awards include ALA Notable Children&#39;s Book, Booklist Children&#39;s Editors&#39; Choice, IRA-CBC Children&#39;s Choice, Learning: The Year&#39;s Ten Best, and several Junior Literary Guild Selections. Ms. Noble has studied children&#39;s book writing and illustrating in New York City at Parsons School of Design, the New School University, Caldecott medalist Uri Shulevitz&#39;s Greenwich Village Workshop, and at New York University. A member of the Rutgers University Council on Children&#39;s Literature, she was awarded Outstanding Woman 2002 in Arts and Letters in the state of New Jersey for her lifetime work in children&#39;s books. Ms. Noble currently lives in the historic Jockey Hollow area of Bernardsville, New Jersey.Grade 3-5-Noble's story, well told in simple descriptive language, shows both the prevalent mood of anxiety in Philadelphia in 1777, as the American colonists awaited the British attack, and the realistic side of war, the pathos of young lives lost, and the stubborn persistence and faith that helped the colonists win. Maddy Rose, the plucky young daughter of a widow whose earnings come from spinning flax, spends her days sewing seams in the linens her mother supplies to a local upholstery shop. At night, using her own hand-knit scarlet stockings and white petticoats, the girl leaves weekly signals on a clothesline, pointing out the location of suspicious ships in the harbor for her beloved brother, serving in General Washington's army. Several nights after she spies a British man-of-war, another boy comes in Jonathan's place, bearing her brother's blue coat in a bundle. After the British defeat, Maddy hangs an American flag made from that coat and her scarlet stockings and white petticoats on the clothesline. Papp is a master of portraiture. His soft, realistic, full- and double-page oils are finely detailed and appear to have been painted from live models. The action, facial expressions, and scenic detail keep many illustrations from appearing staged and static. Children with little knowledge of this period in American history will gain some background from Noble's story.<i>-Susan Scheps, Shaker Heights Public Library, OH</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

So these women form a Women's Murder Club to collaborate outside the box and pursue the case by sidestepping their bosses and giving each other a hand. The four women develop intense bonds as they pursue a killer whose crimes have stunned an entire city. Working together, they track down the most terrifying and unexpected killer they have ever encountered--before a shocking conclusion in which everything they knew turns out to be devastatingly wrong.<br>Full of the breathtaking drama and unforgettable emotions for which James Patterson is famous, <i>1st to Die</i> is the start of the #1<i> New York Times</i> bestselling series of crime thrillers.</p><p>The Women's Murder Club pits four San Francisco women professionals against a serial killer who's stalking and murdering newlyweds in bestselling author James Patterson's newest thriller. Lindsay Boxer is a homicide inspector who's just gotten some very bad news. She deals with it by immersing herself in her newest case and soliciting the personal as well as professional support of her closest friend, who happens to be the city's medical examiner. The two women, along with an ambitious and sympathetic reporter and an assistant DA, form an unlikely alliance, pooling their information and bypassing the chain of command in an engaging, suspenseful story whose gruesome setup is vintage Patterson. <p> "What is the worst thing anyone has ever done?" the killer muses to himself early in the narrative. "Am I capable of doing it? Do I have what it takes?" Answering his own question, he embarks on a murderous spree that takes him from the bridal suite in a Nob Hill hotel to a honeymoon destination in the Napa Valley and thence to a wedding reception at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland, Ohio. Dispatching his victims on the happiest day of their lives, he purposefully leaves enough clues for his distaff trackers to discover his identity and put him behind bars. But just when the women think they've got the case all wrapped up, the killer turns the tables on them in a bloody denouement that even the most discerning reader won't see coming. Patterson, author of the popular Alex Cross mysteries, promises future adventures for the Women's Murder Club, which may give him an opportunity to develop his heroines' characters more completely and win new fans among those who prefer their detectives in high heels and lipstick. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>7 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Corduroy Goes to the Doctor (lg format)</h2><p><b>Join this classic bear on his trip to the doctor.&nbsp;</b><br><br>The youngest fans of Corduroy, one of the best-loved children's book characters for the past fifty years, will delight in these simple, sturdy board books-now available in a larger size with an updated, modern look.&nbsp;<br><br> In&nbsp;<i>Corduroy Goes to the Doctor,</i>&nbsp;Corduroy gets a check-up.</p><p>Don Freeman was born in San Diego, California, in 1908. At an early age, he received a trumpet as a gift from his father. He practiced obsessively and eventually joined a California dance band. After graduating from high school, he ventured to New York City to study art under the tutelage of Joan Sloan and Harry Wickey at the Art Students' League. He managed to support himself throughout his schooling by playing his trumpet evenings, in nightclubs and at weddings.<br><br>Gradually, he eased into making a living sketching impressions of Broadway shows for <i>The New York Times</i> and <i>The Herald Tribune</i>. This shift was helped along, in no small part, by a rather heartbreaking incident: he lost his trumpet. One evening, he was so engrossed in sketching people on the subway, he simply forgot it was sitting on the seat beside him. This new career turned out to be a near-perfect fit for Don, though, as he had always loved the theater.<br><br>He was introduced to the world of children&#x2019;s literature when William Saroyan asked him to illustrate several books. Soon after, he began to write and illustrate his own books, a career he settled into comfortably and happily. Through his writing, he was able to create his own theater: "I love the flow of turning the pages, the suspense of what's next. Ideas just come at me and after me. It's all so natural. I work all the time, long into the night, and it's such a pleasure. I don't know when the time ends. I've never been happier in my life!"<br><br>Don died in 1978, after a long and successful career. He created many beloved characters in his lifetime, perhaps the most beloved among them a stuffed, overall-wearing bear named Corduroy.<br><br>Don Freeman was the author and illustrator of many popular books for children, including <i>Corduroy</i>, <i>A Pocket for Corduroy</i>, and the Caldecott Honor Book <i>Fly High, Fly Low</i>.<p>PreS Don Freeman's Corduroy (Viking, 1968) has always been a welcome figure to children, but these two spinoffs from the classic bear's story are too cutesy and watered down to provoke much interest. Both board books transport Corduroy (with pocket intact) from the realistic world which he normally shares with Lisa to an anthropomorphic suburb, filled with cartoon-like stuffed animals and dolls that could give Strawberry Shortcake a run for her money. Corduroy Goes to the Doctor, the stronger of the two, follows the procedures of a physical exam from beginning to end, and, thus, may be useful for those needing books about doctor visits for the nursery set. Corduroy's Busy Street has no storyline; rather, it's a series of one-page introductions to some of the workers one might meet in a ``typical'' neighborhood. Without any discernible order to guide it, the book seems disjointed, and the characters appear to be quite randomly selected. Neither book captures the endearing qualities of Freeman's ``Corduroy''; both use him only as a vehicle for attracting unsuspecting readers. Rosemary Wells' ``Max'' books (Dial) and Eric Hill's ``Spot'' books (Putnam) are still tops at introducing preschoolers to the everyday facts of life in the grown-up world; these are poor substitutes.

States all over the country were waking up, having their first cups of coffee, reading the morning paper, and enjoying the beautiful sunrise.</i></p><p><i>All the states, that is, except for Kansas."</i></p><p>At the first annual "states party," Virginia and Idaho hatch a plan to swap spots so each can see another part of the country. Before the party is over, all the states decide to switch places. In the beginning, every state is happy in its new location. But soon things start to go wrong. Will the states ever unscramble themselves and return to their proper places?</p><p>Packed with madcap humor and whimsical illustrations, this quirky story-starring all fifty states-is chock-full of introductory facts and silly antics that will make learning geography as much fun as taking a vacation.</p><br><p>This title has Common Core connections.</p></p><p>One day, Kansas wakes up grumpy. The other 49 states are stretching, yawning, and pouring maple syrup onto each other's pancakes, but irritable Kansas announces to his kindly neighbor Nebraska that life is dull and changes <i>must</i> be made: "All day long we just sit here in the middle of the country. We never GO anywhere. We never DO anything, and we NEVER meet any NEW states!" Nebraska, sick of hearing North Dakota and South Dakota bicker all the time, agrees to help organize a party for all the states. It's a hit! Late into the evening, Idaho and Virginia get up onto the stage and suggest that all the states change places. What a state of affairs. Minnesota, who switches places with Florida, gets a sunburn. Kansas, having traded places with Hawaii, gets lonely and sings some soggy blues so sad that a shark sheds a mournful tear offshore. Nevada and Mississippi fall in love. Despite the initial excitement, the new arrangement just doesn't feel right. The states manage to swim, fly, bike, and hitchhike their way home, and everyone goes to bed in the right place--even Kansas is happy to be home after such an adventure. This wacky, thoroughly engaging tale of mixed-up geography is a good bet for some awards. Perhaps best of all, the large format and riot of detail allow for plenty of amusing asides. Books that claim to "make geography fun" usually have to be taken with a dose of skepticism: so often, the teaching is there and the entertainment isn't. This delightfully quirky and original book shows how it should be done.

But there's another, unsung bee that has the potential to save the planet&#x2015;the mason bee. <br><br> <i>Mason Bee Revolution</i> explains how docile, hard-working, solitary mason bees (and their compatriots, the leafcutter bees) are even more productive pollinators than honeybees, and keeping them can be a fun, easy, backyard hobby for gardeners, conservationists, foodies, and families everywhere. <br><br> Why these bees? Bee pollination is critical for about 80 percent of US agricultural crops, increasing crop value by an estimated $15 billion annually. Since 2006, nearly a third of all honeybee hives have been lost each year, due to parasites, pesticides, habitat loss, climate change, and a newer malady called Colony Collapse Disorder. While scientists search for answers to save the honeybee, Dave Hunter and his company, Crown Bees, are leading the effort to increase the population of other highly efficient pollinators: One mason bee can produce twelve pounds of cherries, via pollination, where it would take sixty honey bees to achieve the same. <br><br> <i>Mason Bee Revolution</i> is an easy-to-follow guide to keeping both mason and leafcutter bees. It tells you how to set up, care for, and harvest your own bees and what types of plants and habitat encourage mason and leafcutter bees, as well as provides general information on other common pollinators and bee-related facts, projects, and personalities.</p><p>Dave Hunter is founder and past president of the Orchard Bee Association and serves on an advisory panel to the US Department of Agriculture's National Institute for Food and Agriculture.

But her return home and a visit from Klara result in magical moments that will leave young readers thoroughly captivated by this heartwarming tale of an unforgettable child and her effect on the people around her.<br>Complete and unabridged, this story "for children and those who love children" will thrill today's youngsters just as it has delighted generations of young readers and listeners since its original publication in 1881.</p><p></p></p><p>Johanna Spyri's classic story of a young orphan sent to live with her grumpy grandfather in the Swiss Alps is retold in it's entirety in this beautifully bound hardcover edition. <i>Heidi</i> has charmed and intrigued readers since it's original publication in 1880. Much more than a children's story, the narrative is also a lesson on the precarious nature of freedom, a luxury too often taken for granted. Heidi almost loses her liberty as she is ripped away from the tranquility of the mountains to tend to a sick cousin in the city. Happily, all's well that ends well, and the reader is left with only warm, fuzzy thoughts. Spryi's story will never grow wearisome--and this is a very appealing edition. <i>--Naomi Gesinger</i>6 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>Horse Diaries #2: Bell&#39;s Star</h2><p>Vermont, 1850s<br><br>Bell&#x2019;s Star is a brown Morgan colt with a white star and two white stockings.

Light snow fell from the sky, covering my brown fur with white. My mother&#x2019;s tongue washed over me and warmed my skin. Soon she nudged me, urging me to stand.<br><i>Rise, </i>she told me. <i>Danger can hide in the dark woods.<br></i>I scrambled to my feet. My long legs were sturdy, my body stout. I nursed, and my mother&#x2019;s milk gave me strength. I hopped in the snow, trying out my legs. Mother smiled proudly as I trotted and leaped. Soon I grew weary. Mother led me into the shed, and sinking onto a soft pile of hay, I slept.<br>Morning came, and the rising sun broke through the clouds. As soon as it was light, my mother began to teach me.<br><i>There is so much to learn, </i>she told me. I followed her around the paddock. She touched her nose to all the new things: <i>fence,</i> <i>tree, water trough, hay, mud.</i><br><i>Mud </i>I learned quickly. As the snow melted, my tiny hooves sank into the sloppy brown mess. I was scrambling onto a dry stump when a fluttering sound startled me.<br>A bright blue creature landed on the fence. I tensed. <i>Is this danger? </i>I asked my mother.<br>Her muzzle twitched in laughter. <i>No, my son. That is a blue jay. They are pesky and steal my corn, but they are not danger.<br></i>Jumping off the stump, I whinnied to the blue jay. It flew into the trees.<br><i>Blue jays have wings, </i>my mother explained. <i>They are free to fly to wherever they want.</i><br>I peered between the fence rails. I wanted to race after the blue jay to the place called <i>wherever they want. </i>The blue jay had disappeared, but outside the paddock were many more new things to explore!<br>I touched my nose to the railing, but the fence circled my mother and me, penning us in. I checked my back. Did I have wings? All I saw was brown hair.<br><i>If only I had wings, </i>I thought. <i>I could fly free, too.<br></i>Suddenly a shriek filled the air. I fled behind my mother. I flicked my fuzzy ears.<br><i>Danger? </i>Turning, I peeked from beneath her thick black tail.<br>A creature leaped over the top railing, landing with a splash in the mud. It was as colorful and noisy as the blue jay, only bigger!<br>Wings spread wide, it hurtled toward me. Terrified, I turned to run, but my long legs tangled. I fell in a heap. Mud splattered my white star. The giant blue jay plopped on the ground next to me. Its wings wrapped tightly around my neck, and I was trapped!<br><i>Mother, </i>I neighed. <i>Danger!<br></i>But my mother&#x2019;s eyes were twinkling.<br>&#x201c;Papa! Bell had her foal!&#x201d; the blue jay cried out.<br>&#x201c;I see, Miss Katie,&#x201d; an even taller blue jay answered. &#x201c;But, daughter, your joy is scaring him. Let him go so we can see how fine he is.&#x201d;<br>The wings released me. I scrambled to my hooves and rushed to the far side of the paddock. My mother hurried after me and blew into my nostrils.<br><i>Do not be afraid. Those are humans. The large one is Papa. The small one is Katie. They feed and care for us. In return, we work for them.<br>Work. </i>I did not know that word yet. My mother pushed me forward. My legs splayed, refusing to move. The human called Papa set a wooden bucket in the paddock.<br>&#x201c;Come, Bell,&#x201d; he called. My mother trotted over. Dipping her head, she ate hungrily.<br>&#x201c;You have given us a fine fellow, Bell,&#x201d; Papa said, patting her neck.<br>Wide-eyed and trembling, I stared at the human called Katie. She stood in the middle of the paddock, her eyes as curious as mine.<br>Then she held out one wing. This time she walked quietly to me. Her wings were soft when they stole around my neck. Then her cheek pressed against mine, and my trembling stopped.<br>&#x201c;He has a white star, just like Bell,&#x201d; Katie said. &#x201c;And look, two white legs.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s a fine-looking Morgan horse. Strong like his dam. Handsome like his sire,&#x201d; Papa said. &#x201c;Soon he&#x2019;ll be able to pull the plow and the carriage.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Papa, may I name him?&#x201d; Katie asked. He nodded. <br>&#x201c;I name him Bell&#x2019;s Star.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a grand name for such a small foal,&#x201d; Papa said.<br>&#x201c;One day he <i>will </i>be grand, I know,&#x201d; Katie said, scratching my fuzzy mane. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll lead the St. Albans parade like Mr. Jones&#x2019;s Morgan horse.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s hope he grows up to be as grand a worker as Bell,&#x201d; Papa said. &#x201c;Our farm needs a Morgan that can pull a plow, not lead a parade.&#x201d;<br>I nuzzled Katie&#x2019;s arm. I didn&#x2019;t know <i>grand </i>or <i>parade, </i>but I wanted to show her I no<i> </i>longer thought she was <i>danger.<br></i>&#x201c;Oh, Papa,&#x201d; Katie sighed, her breath tickling my whiskers. &#x201c;I love him already.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll give Bell a day of rest,&#x201d; Papa said. &#x201c;Then it&#x2019;s back to work tomorrow.&#x201d;<br><i>Work. </i>There was that word again. That morning, with Katie&#x2019;s arms around my neck, I thought nothing more of it.<br>But soon I would know what it meant.</p><h2>Towers of Midnight: Book Thirteen of The Wheel of Time (Wheel of Time, 13)</h2><p><p><b>The Wheel of Time </b><b>� is a PBS Great American Read Selection!

In <i>Reinforcement Learning</i>, Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto provide a clear and simple account of the field's key ideas and algorithms. This second edition has been significantly expanded and updated, presenting new topics and updating coverage of other topics.</p><p>Like the first edition, this second edition focuses on core online learning algorithms, with the more mathematical material set off in shaded boxes. Part I covers as much of reinforcement learning as possible without going beyond the tabular case for which exact solutions can be found. Many algorithms presented in this part are new to the second edition, including UCB, Expected Sarsa, and Double Learning. Part II extends these ideas to function approximation, with new sections on such topics as artificial neural networks and the Fourier basis, and offers expanded treatment of off-policy learning and policy-gradient methods. Part III has new chapters on reinforcement learning's relationships to psychology and neuroscience, as well as an updated case-studies chapter including AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero, Atari game playing, and IBM Watson's wagering strategy. The final chapter discusses the future societal impacts of reinforcement learning.</p></p><p>Richard S. Sutton is Professor of Computing Science and AITF Chair in Reinforcement Learning and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Alberta, and also Distinguished Research Scientist at DeepMind.<br><br>Andrew G. Barto is Professor Emeritus in the College of Computer and Information Sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.<p>&#x201c;The second edition of Reinforcement Learning by Sutton and Barto comes at just the right time. The appetite for reinforcement learning among machine learning researchers has never been stronger, as the field has been moving tremendously in the last twenty years. If you want to fully understand the fundamentals of learning agents, this is the textbook to go to and get started with. It&nbsp;has been extended with modern developments in deep reinforcement learning while extending the scholarly history of the field to modern days. I will certainly recommend it to all my students and the many other graduate students and researchers who want to get the appropriate context behind the current excitement for RL.&#x201d;</p>&#x2015;<b>Yoshua Bengio</b>, Professor of Computer Science and Operations Research, University of Montreal</p><h2>Edge of Extinction #1: The Ark Plan</h2><p><p><strong><em>Jurassic World</em> meets <em>Dawn of the Planet of the Apes</em> in this epic new middle grade series full of heart-pounding action and breathtaking chills!

Included is an introduction by Dr. Seuss's longtime editor explaining how the book came to be and reproductions of Dr. Seuss's original pencil sketches and hand-printed notes for the book&#x2014;a true find for all Seuss collectors!&nbsp; Jack Prelutsky and Lane Smith pay homage to the Good Doctor in their own distinctive ways, the result of which is the union of three one-of-a-kind voices in a brand-new, completely original book that is greater than the sum of its parts. For all of us who will never forget our school days and that special teacher, here is a book to give and to get.</p><p>With the release of <i>Hooray for Diffendoofer Day!</i> readers young and old are afforded a dazzling glimpse into the genius of Theodor "Dr. Seuss" Geisel. The book is based on 14 rough drawings and verses Geisel's secretary gave to the author's editor, Janet Schulman, after his death in 1991. In these scribbled sketches and scratched-out lines, we witness the Seussian process in building a story. When brainstorming the name of what resulted in the Diffendoofer School, he jots down several possible names--"William Wilkins Woofer Junior," "Woodrow Watkins Woofer," "Zoofendorf Elementary," "J. Ebeneezer Bomberg Jr."--all of a slightly different cadence and rhythm, which he tests like a composer writing a new concerto.<p> A small collection of Geisel's rough sketches would be plenty to thrill even the Grinchiest of readers, but there's much more to this marvelous book. Renowned children's poet Jack Prelutsky and award-winning illustrator Lane Smith were called to action by Schulman to pull these sketches into a complete story that would make Dr. Seuss fruffulous with glee. Prelutsky's delicious verse is uncannily Seussian, and it is inexplicably sensational when exploring the Diffendoofer School to discover good old Horton, a platter of green eggs and ham, and a few <i>Whos</i> from <i>Who</i>-ville scattered across the surreal and fascinating landscape of Smith's artwork. Lane and Prelutsky have gone above and beyond the call of duty, maintaining the characters and themes Geisel was just beginning to develop, but enhancing them with their own delightful stylistic stamps. </p><p>Above all, this incredible book is an ode to unorthodox, unusually creative teachers, and the innovative thinking they encourage in young minds. (Miss Twining, for example, teaches "how to tell chrysanthemums from miniature poodles.") It is a noble theme, and one that Geisel surely had in mind when he concocted these preliminary sketches. Both new Dr. Seuss aficionados and those who remember <i>The Cat in the Hat</i>'s 1957 debut will cherish this book for its message, artwork, and poetry, and most of all, as a tribute to the man who inspired thousands of readers. <i>(Age 3 and older)</i></p>Started by Seuss, finished by Jack Prelutsky, and splendiferously illustrated by Lane Smith, this is the children&#39;s book publishing event of the year! Big--56 pages--and bursting with energy, here is a joyous ode to individuality, starring an unsinkable teacher named Miss Bonkers and quirky little Diffendoofer School, which must prove it has taught its students how to think--or have them sent to dreary Flobbertown. Included is an introduction by Dr. Seuss&#39;s longtime editor explaining how the book came to be and reproducing Dr. Seuss&#39;s 1989 original pencil sketches and hand-printed notes for the book--a true find for all Seuss collectors.

Reorganized into eight sections--each comprising the major fields of critical controversy and analysis--this new edition features reformulated introductions and biographical headnotes that contextualize the readings, making the text more accessible than ever to students, film enthusiasts, and general readers alike. The seventh edition also integrates exciting new material on feminist theory, queer cinema, and global cinema, as well as a new section, "Digitization and Globalization," which engages important recent developments in technology and world cinema.<br> <br> A wide-ranging critical and historical survey, <em>Film Theory and Criticism</em> remains the leading text for undergraduate courses in film theory.

In this eagerly anticipated fourth volume in the series, Meier approaches a fresh topic&#x2014;the teachings of the historical Jesus concerning Mosaic Law and morality&#x2014;with the same rigor, thoroughness, accuracy, and insightfulness on display in his earlier works.</p><p>After correcting misconceptions about Mosaic Law in Jesus&#x2019; time, this volume addresses the teachings of Jesus on major legal topics like divorce, oaths, the Sabbath, purity rules, and the various love commandments in the Gospels. What emerges from Meier&#x2019;s research is a profile of a complicated first-century Palestinian Jew who, far from seeking to abolish the Law, was deeply engaged in debates about its observance. Only by embracing this portrait of the historical Jesus grappling with questions of the Torah do we avoid the common mistake of constructing Christian moral theology under the guise of studying &#x201c;Jesus and the Law,&#x201d; the author concludes.</p></p><p><p>John P.

More recently, writers have shown an increased awareness that American society, far from developing in a protected, ahistorical realm, can be understood only as part of a wider civilization. Now E. Christian Kopff offers an even sharper perspective by viewing America squarely within the classical traditions of ancient Greece and Rome. For, as Kopff demonstrates convincingly, a truly informed, nuanced view of American culture must rest upon an appreciation of our debt to the classical past. Kopff, a professor of classical studies at the University of Colorado at Boulder, reveals a nation that, for all its self-conscious pursuit of a new secular order, cannot break free from tradition. &#34;Creativity is possible,&#34; he observes, &#34;only as the final stage in a long, rigorous absorption of the teachings and discoveries of the past.&#34; If we ignore the accumulated wisdom, insight, and experience of those who lived before us, Kopff argues, and look only ahead as if we could live by mere innovation, we will stagnate. He understands the irony of our predicament and employs his wit and erudition to devastating effects. Wholly immersed in the distant past, Kopff nevertheless offers incisive commentary on the modern world. From his classical vantage, Kopff examines the interplay of such seemingly unrelated subjects as postmodernism and pop culture to reveal the deleterious effect pseudo-intellectualism can have on America. And he offers original assessments of another pop culture icon, the ubiquitous Top 100 Lists. With a keen eye and rapier wit, Kopff grades the list makers who would decide which books and movies belong in everyone&#39;s repertoire. The Devil Knows Latin is a learned, often irreverent, and thought-provoking examination of American culture at century&#39;s end.&#34;Christian Kopff is a distinguished teacher and an independent thinker-vital, though rare, qualities these days in classics&#39; eleventh hour.&#34;-Victor Davis Hanson, co-author of Who Killed Homer? &#34;E. Christian Kopff cuts to the heart of the Culture Wars. Drawing on a wellspring of sources-from Aristotle to Tolkien, The Republic to High Noon-Kopff champions tradition and the &#39;permanent things&#39; and highlights the cost of our cultural amnesia. His value is not in telling us what we should know, but in reminding us of what we forget at our peril.&#34;-Theodore Pappas, Executive Editor, Encyclopaedia Britannica</p><h2>The Curious Writer (5th Edition)</h2><p><i>For courses in First-Year Composition - Rhetoric.<br> </i> <br> <b>Puts inquiry at the heart of good writing</b> <br> <i>We write to learn as much as we do to express what we already know</i>.

Lake Sermons on Dominion over Demons, Disease and Death</h2><p>This book contains a selection of faith-inspiring messages by Dr. John G. Lake whose healing ministry in missionary fields was considered the greatest of his generation.</p><p></p><h2>Essentials of Abnormal Psychology</h2><p>Revised to reflect DSM-5, this briefer version of Durand and Barlow&#39;s widely used book fully describes abnormal psychology through the authors&#39; standard-setting integrative approach--the most modern, scientifically valid method for studying the subject. Through this approach, readers learn that psychological disorders are rarely caused by a single influence, but rooted in the interaction among multiple factors: biological, psychological, cultural, social, familial, and even political. A conversational writing style, consistent pedagogy, and real case profiles--95 percent from the authors&#39; own case files--provide a realistic context for the scientific findings of the book. In addition, these features ensure that readers never lose sight of the fact that real people are behind the DSM-5 criteria, the theories, and the research.</p><p>V.

It includes a powerful reinterpretation of Greek thought, a sweeping vision of Western history, and a glimpse of the reasons behind Heidegger's support of the Nazi Party in the 1930s. Heidegger tries to reawaken the "question of Being" by challenging some of the most enduring prejudices embedded in Western philosophy and in our everyday practices and language. Furthermore, he relates this question to the insights of Greek tragedy into the human condition and to the political and cultural crises of modernity.<p>This new translation makes this work more accessible to students than ever before. It combines smoothness with accuracy and provides conventional translations of Greek passages that Heidegger translated unconventionally. There are also extensive notes, a German-English glossary, and an introduction that discusses the history of the text, its basic themes, and its place in Heidegger's oeuvre.</p></p><p>Gregory Fried is assistant professor of philosophy and humanities at Boston University.

The book outlines the current state of family trends, the diversity of family forms in the United States, and underlying relationships to race, gender, class, and sexual orientation. The authors cover the effects of social problems, and the policies designed to combat them, in major areas such as welfare, food, and housing; work and employment; health care; the care and support of children; family violence; domestic partnerships and marriage; and aging. The book includes theoretical frameworks for conceptualizing poverty, and outlines the policy practice roles that professionals play in developing, implementing, and monitoring family policy. The combination of real family histories and the analysis of government interventions in The Dynamics of Family Policy will enable students to identify and maximize their role as they begin their careers in the helping professions.</p><p>Alice K.

Keller continues to offer the most detailed, current research available. He covers a wide range of topics, discussing everything from fundamental geologic principles to the specifics of environmental law and geologic hazards, from a truly environmental perspective. The <b>Ninth Edition</b> emphasizes the engineering geology approach, especially in the discussion of soil and rock mechanics and landslides.</p><p>Ideal for students with little or no previous exposure to the study of geology, this text offers one of the most comprehensive, up-to-date treatments of environmental geology available -- from fundamental geologic principles to the specifics of environmental law and geological hazards. It fully discusses both processes and environmental issues, and where appropriate, includes Special Features boxes with quantification of processes.PREFACE <p> Environmental geology is the application of geologic information to the entire spectrum of interactions between people and our physical environment. Those students who become more interested in the subject may go on to become environmental geologists. They will take advanced courses in subjects such as engineering geology and hydrogeology. </p><p> Study of environmental geology is facilitated by previous exposure to an introductory physical geology or geography course. However, most students may not have the flexibility in their undergraduate curriculum to take more than a single geology course. As a result, Environmental Geology is designed so that students who have had no previous exposure to the geological sciences may comprehend and understand the principles of environmental geology. This requires that a fair amount of physical geology is presented along with discussion of relationships between geology and the environment. One important objective of the book is to present a broad spectrum of subject matter relevant to students studying a wide variety of traditional sciences such as chemistry, biology, geology, physical geography, and physics; liberal arts students studying subjects such as anthropology, economics, environmental studies, human geography, literature, political science, and sociology; and students who may be preparing for professional schools such as engineering, architecture, or planning. ORGANIZATION </p><p> The organization of the eighth edition is similar to the seventh with appropriate expansion of the two water chapters: water supply and management, and water pollution. The continuing emphasis on water results because of the tremendous importance of water resources and their use to all people on earth. Of particular significance is the added material concerning surface and groundwater processes. Since the seventh edition, the subjects of earth system science and air pollution are now stand-alone chapters. The subject of earth system science and global change is of particular importance to environmental geology, and considerable discussion has been added concerning such global environmental problems as potential global warming, stratospheric ozone depletion, and acid rain. </p><p> The subject material for Environmental Geology is arranged in five parts. Part 1 introduces fundamental principles important in the study of environmental geology. The purpose is to set the philosophical framework for the remainder of the text, as well as to introduce important aspects of geology necessary to undertake a study of applied geology. Emphasis is on geologic process and the study of the earth as a system. This is facilitated through study of earth materials such as minerals, rocks, soils as they relate to processes operating in the solid earth, biosphere, hydrosphere (surface and groundwaters), and atmosphere. </p><p> Part 2 addresses the important subject of natural processes (hazards) that continue to make life on earth occasionally difficult for people. These include flooding, landslides, earthquakes, volcanoes, and coastal erosion. Discussion of hazardous natural processes is facilitated through the introduction of numerous case histories that represent the spectrum of hazards and the response of society. New case histories or discussions include the 1993 floods of the Mississippi River and the 1994 earthquake that damaged part of the Los Angeles, California, area. </p><p> Part 3 focuses on human interactions with the environment and includes detailed discussions of water resources, water pollution, integrated waste management, and geologic aspects of environmental health. In particular, the material in Chapters 10 and 11 has been completely reorganized and updated in light of important issues related to water as a resource and water pollution. Finally, because groundwater processes are becoming so important in many environmental geology areas, additional discussion is provided so that students might better understand the physical processes related to the occurrence and movement of groundwater. </p><p> Part 4 includes the important topics of mineral and energy resources as they pertain to needs of society and environmental issues. Emphasis is placed on the origin and significance of our mineral and energy resources, as well as their availability and environmental impact associated with their development. </p><p> Part 5 introduces the subjects of earth system science, global change, air pollution, environmental evaluation, and environmental law. For the eighth edition, the material on earth system science and global change as it relates to global environmental problems has been revised to include a more thorough discussion of stratospheric ozone depletion and global warming. The subjects of environmental impact analysis, land-use planning, and environmental law have been combined into a single chapter that integrates these subjects and highlights the usefulness of environmental geology to society. SOME SPECIAL FEATURES </p><p> The eighth edition of Environmental Geology includes a complete reorganization of the chapters: The eighth edition presents some quantitative examples in the Putting Some Numbers On boxes, which discuss a variety of processes, including: exponential growth; soil mechanics; flood frequency analysis; landslide stability analysis; construction of a beach budget; groundwater movement; and construction of the design response spectra for evaluating the earthquake hazard at a site. Each chapter begins with a photograph and an accompanying short explanatory narrative, followed by learning objectives. The purpose of the learning objectives is to inform students about what is important in that chapter. Selected Case History boxes are separated from the general text so that students might better focus on important issues. A Closer Look special feature boxes discuss important issues or concepts separately from the general text. For example, A Closer Look: Wetlands in Chapter 10 defines wetlands and important environmental processes of wetlands. Key terms presented in the text are listed at the end of each chapter to further assist students in their study of the material. Study questions are provided for each chapter with the intent of stimulating discussion of important issues related to environmental geology. There are only a few questions for each chapter but the emphasis is on developing critical thinking skills about the text material. Useful Web sites are listed in Appendix A: World Wide Web: An Introductory Statement. SPECIAL NOTES TO STUDENTS </p><p> I wrote part of the first edition of Environmental Geology while I was still a graduate student at Purdue University. As a student I was very interested in trying to understand this new field of environmental geology that a few people were beginning to talk about. I taught a class in environmental geology at Indiana University-Purdue University in Indianapolis, Indiana. At that time, in the early 1970s, we were just becoming conscious of environmental problems and were more concerned with identifying the problems rather than dealing with solutions. Since then, the field of environmental geology has grown substantially, and there are many practicing professional environmental geologists. The focus has also shifted to finding solutions to environmental problems. This requires increased understanding of application of geologic processes to the environment. As a result, we need to know more about how the earth works and how the subject of geology interrelates with other disciplines, such as biology, chemistry, physics, and geography. Some of the most fruitful areas for research for future students will be interdisciplinary studies that combine one or more of the other sciences. Environmental geology, however, is more than just science. Our science may provide potential solutions to environmental problems and outline risk of such processes as earthquakes and flooding. What we decide to do about our environmental problems is more related to our value system. As a result, subjects such as psychology, social anthropology, history, human geography, political science, law and society, and economics come to the forefront. People who will solve environmental problems in the future will continue to be more interdisciplinary in their research approach and their study of the environment. The upshot of all this is that our study of the environment is becoming broader on one hand and more rigorous on the other. In response to this, I have made no attempt to dodge difficult subjects such as hydraulic conductivity, fluid pressure in rocks and soils, moment magnitude of earthquakes, and processes related to stratospheric ozone depletion. I am confident that students remain interested in obtaining the best possible education and expect to be challenged. I have made every attempt to discuss difficult subjects in a way that will enable students to better understand what is happening. However, many of these subjects are difficult, and considerable study is necessary to understand them thoroughly. Finally, more advanced courses in areas such as hydrogeology, geochemistry, and seismology are suggested for those students who wish to pursue these subjects further. </p><p> </p><p> I have learned a great deal in preparing Environmental Geology. I hope you enjoy reading the book and hope that some of you may pursue environmental geology as a career. A few of you may become so intensely interested that you will pursue a research and teaching career to better understand how our earth works and how we might better solve environmental problems. </p><p> Edward A.

The tales range, chronologically, from the writings of her college days and residence in Greenwich Village in the early 1940s, to the unforgettably chilling stories from the period just before her death. They provide an exciting overview of the evolution of her craft through a progression of forms and styles, and add significantly to the body of her published work.<br><i>Just an Ordinary Day</i> is a testament to how large a talent Shirley Jackson had and to the depth, breadth, and complexity of her writing. Though this remarkable literary life was cut short, Jackson clearly established a unique voice that has won a permanent place in the canon of outstanding American literature, and remains a powerful influence on generations of readers and writers.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>The late Shirley Jackson (1919-65) is the author of the classic short story, "The Lottery," a dark, unforgettable tale of the unthinking and murderous customs of a small New England town. She is also the author of several American Gothic novels, such as <i>We Have Always Lived in the Castle</i> and <i>The Haunting of Hill House.</i> Her atmospheric stories explore themes of psychological turmoil, isolation, and the inequity of fate. <i>Just an Ordinary Day</i> is a posthumous collection of 54 short stories (many of which have never been published), edited and introduced by two of Jackson's children. Jackson penned many of the stories in this volume for the popular press, for titles ranging from <i>Fantasy and Science Fiction</i> and <i>The New Yorker</i> to women's magazines such as <i>Charm</i> and <i>Good Housekeeping</i>. The disparity of the intended audience and the divergent styles result in an uneven collection of short stories, some that are outstanding and will be much appreciated by the reading public, others that hold interest only to the die-hard fan or chronicler of Jackson's work.<b>Shirley Jackson </b>was born in San Francisco on December 14, 1916. She first received wide critical acclaim for &#x201c;The Lottery,&#x201d; which was published in <i>The New Yorker </i>in 1948 and went on to become one of the most anthologized stories in American literature. She is the author of six novels, including <i>The Haunting of Hill House</i> and <i>We Have Always Lived in the Castle;</i> four collections of short stories and essays, including <i>Let Me Tell You;</i> and two family memoirs, <i>Life Among the Savages </i>and <i>Raising Demons</i>.

The children had little interest in learning, and were sorely lacking in guidance. How would he transform a group of apathetic kids into disciplined, thoughtful, and curious students? He quickly realized that they needed to learn some basic rules. Clark compiled a list of 55 lessons, and soon, his fifth-grade students-who once struggled to read at the third-grade level-were reading at the sixth-grade level . . . and loving it. What&#39;s more, they were gaining something crucial-self-respect. Those 55 lessons evolved into what Clark calls The Essential 55-guidelines for living and interacting with others The Essential 55 will prepare parents and educators to teach students the rules for life-everything from knowing how to say thank you, to acing an interview.</p><p><strong>Ron Clark</strong> has been a teacher since 1995 and has taught in the most difficult schools in North Carolina and Harlem. Since winning Disney's 2001 Teacher of the Year, he has spoken across the country to teachers, school boards and PTAs to share his 55 Rules. He lives in Atlanta.Tired of unruly, uncivilized students? Here's the structure they need, according to a gutsy young teacher who knows what works in the classroom and in life. These are old-fashioned rules--do your homework every night, say thank you, don't talk at the movies, respect everyone, tell the truth. In today's wide-open culture, some of them will seem demanding. But the message from this North Carolina teacher is that kids feel more secure and happy when these expectations are in place. This welcome initiative is delivered in a way that will inspire the persistence one needs to be carry them out. A valuable resource for people who are too inconsistent with their expectations of children and unhappy with the results.

A century later&#x2014;1951&#x2014;and about a hundred and fifty miles away, another war began when the U.

They assess recent experimental trends and explore the functions of orality, ethnicity, and power in ethnographic composition.<br><br><i>Writing Culture</i> argues that ethnography is in the midst of a political and epistemological crisis: Western writers no longer portray non-Western peoples with unchallenged authority; the process of cultural representation is now inescapably contingent, historical, and contestable.

The galaxies, star clusters, and nebulae cataloged by the famous comet hunter in the late 1700s are still the most widely observed celestial wonders in the heavens. They are the favorite targets of amateur astronomers, with such rich variety and detail that they never cease to fascinate. This book provides new and experienced observers with a fresh perspective on the Messier objects. Stephen James O&#39;Meara has prepared a visual feast for the observer. Using the finest optical telescopes available for amateur work, he describes and sketches the view from the telescope as never before. There are new drawings, improved finder charts, and new astronomical data on each object, including findings from the Hubble Space Telescope. Expand your universe and test your viewing acumen with this truly modern Messier Guide. It is a must for budding night watchers. Stephen James O&#39;Meara is a contributing editor to Sky and Telescope.</p><p>Steve O'Meara has been called "the best visual planetary observer of modern times." The first to spot Comet Halley on its return in 1985, the first to determine the rotation period of Uranus, he now turns his amazing visual skills to the deep sky.<p> Charles Messier was one of the best comet hunters of the 1700s, with 12 comet discoveries to his credit. He was frustrated because he kept wasting time looking at fuzzy objects that turned out not to be comets. The list he kept and published of "things that aren't comets" turned out to be his ticket to immortality.</p><p> </p><blockquote> Amateur astronomers of all ages enjoy tackling the Messier catalogue members, because they represent a good sampling of what's "out there," and because finding them helps to hone observing skills. In a sense, the Messier objects are the testing grounds for budding skywatchers. </blockquote><p> O'Meara's guide is unique in conveying his approach to observing: "It's an approach based on creative perception and on using the imagination to see patterns and shapes in the subjects seen through the eyepiece. It involves using not just your eye but also your <i>mind's eye</i> to associate those patterns and shapes with things that are familiar with you, to create pictures and even stories." With O'Meara as your docent, you will truly appreciate the art of the universe. <i>--Mary Ellen Curtin</i></p>This completely new work will inspire amateur astronomers to visit the 110 most famous galaxies, clusters and nebulae in the sky. It is the ultimate field guide to the Messier objects, first catalogued in the late 1700s.Using the finest optical telescopes available for amateur work, superior eyepieces and the darkest site on Earth, the author describes and sketches the view from the telescope as never before.

Approaching &#x201c;high&#x201d; and &#x201c;low&#x201d; subject matter with equal appetite and comfort, Pettibon plumbs the depths of American sexuality, politics, subcultures, mores, and intellectual histories through themes ranging from Shakespeare to Gumby, surfers to the Bible, baseball to German Romanticism. Published on the occasion of his major European traveling retrospective at the Deichtorhallen Hamburg &#x2013; Sammlung Falckenberg, Raymond Pettibon: Homo Americanus presents over six hundred works from every part of the artist&#x2019;s career, the majority of which have never been shown before. Arranged thematically in thirty-two chapters, this unique catalogue charts the appearance and development of the themes that have come to define Pettibon&#x2019;s expansive oeuvre. Different sections are introduced with excerpts from interviews conducted with the artist, and are further discussed in a detailed appendix by curator Ulrich Loock. Beyond shedding valuable light on the genesis and cross-pollination of Pettibon&#x2019;s thematic interests, this catalogue is the first to tackle the artist&#x2019;s work as a whole&#x2014;as a kind of hive mind of American culture whose various branches constantly address and reinterpret one another. Of particular interest are Pettibon&#x2019;s own readings of individual works in the book. In excerpts paired with corresponding images, Pettibon guides readers through his complex, often meandering turns of thought; never condescending, they invite readers to enter more deeply into his thinking without sacrificing the intellectual rigor and sense of mystery that makes Pettibon&#x2019;s work so compelling and challenging. The book includes a complete facsimile of his first artists&#x2019; book, Captive Chains&#x2014;almost entirely unavailable for decades&#x2014;in addition to numerous early drawings completed with his nephew, record covers, flyers, and sections dedicated to collages and drawings from the 1980s to today. Also featured are biographical notes compiled by Lucas Zwirner, offering a nuanced, insightful reading of Pettibon&#x2019;s history, whose early life and work is often simplified and categorically tied to punk rock, and instead underscores the complexities surrounding the artist&#x2019;s long-standing relationship with art, literature, and American culture. This unparalleled selection of Pettibon&#x2019;s work is the definitive single volume for novices and experts alike.</p><p>Raymond Pettibon (b. 1957, Tucson) is known for his work that embraces a wide spectrum of American high and low culture, from the deviations of marginal youth to art history, literature, sports, religion, politics, and sexuality. Taking their points of departure in the Southern California punk-rock culture of the late 1970s and 1980s and the do-it-yourself aesthetic of album covers, comics, concert flyers, and fanzines that characterized the movement, his drawings have come to occupy their own genre of potent and dynamic artistic commentary, ranging from punchy and political to high literary and extremely poetic.An original approach to an art book.

(Robert Storr <i>The New York Review of Books</i>)<br><br>There are many books out there collecting Raymond Pettibon&#x2019;s work, so let&#x2019;s cut to the chase: <i>Homo Americanus: Collected Works</i> is the best on the market.

(Jeff Jackson <i>Fanzine</i>)<br><br>Every so often, a fresh monograph comes out on a well-known, even rock star-status artist. And that artist&#x2019;s fans and collectors purchase the new book, de rigueur, in much the same way that an avid music fan might purchase a greatest-hits or a remixes album &#x2015; out of love and loyalty and connoisseurship and the obsessively acquisitive collector&#x2019;s impulse, but with no real expectation of learning anything new. Well, maybe one or two new or previously unreleased tracks to sweeten the pot. On that score, people who buy <i>Homo Americanus</i> (the new Raymond Pettibon monograph out from David Zwirner Books) are in for a particularly excellent treat &#x2015; but the real surprise is that even Pettibon&#x2019;s biggest fans are in for a new education, too.

As it might sound in the comic books that inspired Pettibon: Thump! (Stephanie Eckardt <i>W Magazine Online</i>)<br><br>Seeing all this ambitious, restlessly self-interrogating work brought together in one place impresses viewers with how diligently Pettibon keeps his grimly witty mastery of word and image from descending into all-out nihilism.

This edition&#39;s new structure is based on research with students about the best way to deliver content in this course! The chapters in Needles/Powers/Crosson have been organized into the Three Section Approach, which helps you more easily digest the content. The first section is Concepts and focuses on the overarching accounting concepts that require consistent reiteration throughout the course. With a clear understanding of the concepts, you are then ready to experience the second section--Accounting Applications. Here you practice the application of accounting procedures with features like &#34;Apply It&#34; and a new transaction analysis model, which clearly illustrates how transactions are the result of business decisions and recorded in a way to show their effects on the financial statements. Finally, you utilize section three, Business Applications. This section illustrates how the concepts and procedures are used to make business decisions. Real company examples are used throughout the chapter to show students the relevance of the material. This logical progression through the material is further supported in the online environment in CengageNOW with the Tri-Level Problem. This problem mirrors the Three Section Approach and connects the sections to facilitate a more complete understanding. These substantial changes will make you a more efficient learner and are designed to prepare you for a business world increasingly complicated by ethical issues, globalization.</p><p>Belverd E.

First, this book lists the vast majority of Greek prepositions, adverbs, particles, relative pronouns, conjunctions, and other connecting words that are notorious for being some of the most difficult words to translate. For each word included, page references are given for several major lexical resources where the user can quickly go to examine the nuances and parameters of the word for translation options. This book will save considerable time for students of the Greek New Testament text. For example, for the Greek preposition <em>en</em> (occurs 2,750 times in the New Testament) covers four pages of small print in the Bauer-Danker lexicon (BDAG). But <em>Interpretive Lexicon</em> digests those pages in just a few lines, with the page numbers and section references given for <em>A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature</em>, 3rd Edition (BDAG, &#x2019;00) and 2nd Edition (BAGD, &#x2019;79), <em>Greek Grammar Beyond the Basics</em> (Daniel B. Wallace), and <em>Prepositions and Theology in the Greek New Testament</em> (Murray J. Harris). Thus, the translation options can be analyzed quickly. For words with a lower frequency of occurrence and fewer translation options, this book may be sufficient in itself as a lexicon.</p><p>Secondly, these prepositions, conjunctions, adverbs, and connecting words in Greek, as in every language, function as explicit discourse-level markers that are essential for ascertaining the main point(s) of a passage. Therefore, this <em>Interpretive Lexicon</em> also evaluates the discourse function(s) of each word that is defined and catalogued, and categorizes its semantic range into defined logical relationships. This feature of the lexicon<em> </em>adds an interpretive<em> </em>element, since translation must include interpretation, at least on a linguistic level. For example, <em>en </em>may be translated in many ways, but those ways are categorized broadly in this book into relationships such as locative (<em>in, among, on</em>), means-end (<em>with, by</em>), grounds (<em>because, on account of</em>), temporal (<em>while, at</em>), and so on. This interpretive feature of the book is tremendously helpful for the exegetical process, allowing for the translator to closely follow the logical flow of the text with greater efficiency. This <em>Interpretive Lexicon</em> is thus a remarkable resource for student, pastor, and scholar alike.&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>Gregory K. Beale (PhD, University of Cambridge) is J. Gresham Machen Chair of New Testatment, Proferssor of New Testament and Bible Theology at Wheaton College Graduate School.</p><br><br><p>William A. Ross is a doctoral student at the University of Cambridge.</p>One of the most challenging tasks in language acquisition is mastering the small words that are the warp and woof of an author&#x2019;s thought. Frequently, these words reveal the logical flow of a discourse and are thus crucial for understanding a given text. Gathering up the data from reference works, principally BDAG, Greg Beale and company have laid out the material in a way that focuses on the various kinds of logical relationships intended by the author. Systematically labeling each word in this lexicon according to sound discourse analysis principles, they have produced a volume whose time has come. -- Daniel B. Wallace, Professor of New Testament Studies, Dallas Theological Seminary<br><br>As evangelical Protestants we believe in sola scriptura. We are committed, therefore, to discovering the meaning of the Scriptures, which means that we must study the Scriptures with intensity and rigor. This invaluable tool assists us in the task of careful exegesis and should be warmly welcomed. -- Thomas R. Schreiner, Professor of New Testament Interpretation; Associate Dean, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary<br><br>Your life depends on the meaning of little words. 'Soldier get in your foxhole now!' If you think 'in' means 'out' you're dead. The stakes are even higher with 'justified by faith.' Or, 'in this hope we were saved.' Or, 'created in Christ Jesus for good works.' Or, 'On account of these the wrath of God is coming.' Beale's Interpretive Lexicon of New Testament Greek is dedicated to the conviction that crucial and glorious things in scripture come into focus through rightly understanding the relationships signaled by these little words. This book wins my affection especially by correlating its definitions with the relational symbols I have been using for 40 years. The book will accomplish a high purpose if it merely heightens the Bible-reader's expectancy that life-changing meaning is found not just in words and phrases, but in how words and phrases relate. Thank you, Dr. Beale and your team. -- John Piper, Chancellor and Professor of New Testament, Bethlehem College and Seminary</p><h2>National Geographic Readers: Weird Sea Creatures</h2><p>Did you know that the deep-sea anglerfish has a glowing fishing rod attached to its body, or that the barreleye fish has a see-through head?

Shirer And tThe Rise And Fall Of The Third Reich</h2><p>The story of legendary American journalist William L. Shirer and how his first-hand reporting on the rise of the Nazis and on World War II brought the devastation alive for millions of AmericansWhen William L. Shirer started up the Berlin bureau of Edward R. Murrow&#x2019;s CBS News in the 1930s, he quickly became the most trusted reporter in all of Europe. Shirer hit the streets to talk to both the everyman and the disenfranchised, yet he gained the trust of the Nazi elite and through these contacts obtained a unique perspective of the party&#x2019;s rise to power.Unlike some of his esteemed colleagues, he did not fall for Nazi propaganda and warned early of the consequences if the Third Reich was not stopped. When the Germans swept into Austria in 1938 Shirer was the only American reporter in Vienna, and he broadcast an eyewitness account of the annexation. In 1940 he was embedded with the invading German army as it stormed into France and oc</p><p><p>Steve Wick is a senior editor at <i>Newsday</i> and the author of <i>Bad Company: Drugs, Hollywood and the Cotton Club Murder</i>, among others.

Steven Heller and Louise Fili, two of the most admired and respected designers working today, cover everything from the classic elegance of the late 19th century to the fractured hypermedia of today.

One finds brief (approximately 300-word) overview essays of seven time periods of typography: pre-modern, early modern, avant-garde modern, commercial modern, late modern, electric modern, and postmodern. Following these essays are shorter sidebar essays that discuss the various international influences within each time period (e.g., "Art Nouveau in Germany, France, The Netherlands, and Austria"). The essays are well written but require some knowledge of artistic and architectural trends. Hundreds of black-and-white and color illustrations from primary sources enrich the text, but, unfortunately, references to their sources are incomplete. The volume concludes with a bibliography of 55 books from the mid-1950s through the early 1990s. All in all, it is difficult to establish the audience for this book: The text is beyond the level of high school and lower-division undergraduates, but there is not enough scholarly apparatus to interest advanced scholars. Recommended for libraries that regularly receive requests for illustrations of historical typefaces or examples of display type.AP. Steven Thomas, Central Michigan Univ. Lib., Mt.

Although Kafka seemed to consider <i>The Castle</i> a failure, critics, in wrestling with its enigmatic meaning, have recognized it as one of the great novels of our century. <br><br>Unfinished at Kafka's death in 1924, the manuscript of <i>The Castle</i> was edited for publication by Kafka's friend and literary executor, Max Brod. Both Brod's edition and the English-language translation of it that was prepared by Willa and Edwin Muir in 1930 have long been considered flawed.<br><br>This new edition of Kafka's terrifying and comic masterpiece is the product of an international team of experts who went back to Kafka's original manuscript and notes to create an edition that is as close as possible to the way the author left it. The <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> hailed their work, saying that it will "decisively alter our understanding of Kafka and render previous editions obsolete."<br><br>Mark Harman's brilliant translation closely follows the fluidity and breathlessness of the sparsely punctuated original manuscript, revealing levels of comedy, energy, and visual power that have not been previously accessible to <br>English-language readers.<br><br>W. H. Auden likened Kafka to Dante, Shakespeare, and Goethe as the single most important writer of his age. Here, in this new edition, is a Kafka for the twenty-first century.</p><p>They are perhaps the most famous literary instructions never followed: "Dearest Max, my last request: Everything I leave behind me ... in the way of diaries, manuscripts, letters (my own and others'), sketches, and so on, [is] to be burned unread...." Thankfully, Max Brod did not honor his friend Franz Kafka's final wishes. Instead, he did everything within his power to ensure that Kafka's work would find publication--including making some sweeping changes in the original texts. Until recently, the world has known only Brod's version of Kafka, with its altered punctuation, word order, and chapter divisions. Restoring much of what had previously been expunged, as well as the fluid, oral quality of Kafka's original German, Mark Harman's new translation of <i>The Castle</i> is a major literary event. <p> One of three unfinished novels left after Kafka's death, <i>The Castle</i> is in many ways the writer's most enduring and influential work. In Harman's muscular translation, Kafka's text seems more modern than ever, the words tumbling over one another, the sentences separated only by commas. Harman's version also ends the same way as Kafka's original manuscript--that is, in mid-sentence: "She held out her trembling hand to K. and had him sit down beside her, she spoke with great difficulty, it was difficult to understand her, but what she said--." For anyone used to reading Kafka in his artificially complete form, the effect is extraordinary; it is as if Kafka himself had just stepped from the room, leaving behind him a work whose resolution is the more haunting for being forever out of reach.</p>Mark Harman's new translation of "The Castle" was the winner of the Modern Language Association's Lois Roth Award (1999). The jury's citation read as follows: <p>"Mark Harman has produced a worthy successor to the long-established 1930 translation by Edwin Muir and Willa Muir. While maintaining high standards of literal accuracy and employing an English that is contemporary in its vocabulary and idiom, he has also fashioned a style that expressively re-creates Kafka's unsettling blend of the mundane and the unnerving, the wryly comic and the obliquely menacing. Harman's syntax in particular, with its controlled and grammatically subversive use of comma splices, captures the narrative's progressive mood of disorientation and bafflement. Mark Harman's translation has recharged the imaginative energy and impact of Kafka's novel, ensuring that its influence in English-speaking countries will in the next century be as powerful as it has been in this."</p></p><h2>Guide to Physical Therapist Practice, Rev 2nd Ed</h2><p>IMPORTANT NOTE: The next edition of APTA's <i>Guide to Physical Therapist Practice, 2nd Edition</i>, will be less an "edition" and more a "version" -- 3.0 to be precise. Guide to Physical Therapist Practice 3.0 is scheduled for release in August 2014. It will be electronic only, as the online links to outside and continually updated resources made it impossible for the Guide to be useful as a static printed book. <p> Especially for educators and students: No printed book means that all you need for your class work is the URL. As long as you access Guide 3.0 via the guidetoptpractice.apta.org website you'll have the most current version, semester after semester. </p><p> APTA will remove the printed Guide to Physical Therapist Practice from its catalog on June 1, and will no longer sell new copies. </p><p>The result of input and collaboration among hundreds of physical therapists, the <i>Guide to Physical Therapist Practice</i>, Revised Second Edition, clearly defines scope of practice; guides patterns of practice; improves quality of care; promotes appropriate use of health care services; and explains physical therapist practice to insurers, policymakers, and other health care professionals. The Guide continues to be an essential resource for both daily practice and professional education. </p><p> The <i>Guide to Physical Therapist Practice</i>, Revised Second Edition, features: </p><ul> <li>A detailed description of the scope of physical therapist practice. </li><li>Tests and measures and interventions sections with expanded clinical indications, examples of tests and measures and data generated. </li><li>Examples in all sections to assist the user in examination and intervention. </li><li>Preferred practice patterns grouped into four major areas: musculoskeletal, neuromuscular, cardiovascular and pulmonary, and integumentary. </li><li>Tests and measures and interventions relevant to each pattern clarified.</li></ul></p><p></p><h2>Ert�&#39;s Fashion Designs (Dover Fine Art, History of Art)</h2><p>Ert� once designed a costume for Mata Hari. Sixty-seven years later, still creating, he designed costumes and sets for the 1980 Glyndebourne Festival's <i>Der Rosenkavalier. </i>In between (mostly in the '20s) he was the only top Paris designer illustrating his own <i>haute couture, </i>most of the illustrations appearing in <i>Harper's Bazar. </i>An earlier volume (<i>Fashion Drawings and Illustrations from "Harper's Bazar" </i>0-486-23397-9) sampled some of Ert�'s enormous contributions to that magazine; this is another collection of original designs from Ert�'s triumphant <i>Harper's Bazar</i> period. <br>"He envisioned women," wrote Stella Blum, Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute Curator, "not only as ultra-chic creatures for whom money was no object, but also as . . . music hall stars, Assyrian princesses, Egyptian queens. . . . Yet under this veil of fantasy the clothes and accessories Ert�&nbsp;created reveal a sound construction that really works." Ert� loves elaborate decoration, but hates meaningless ornament; these 218 illustrations show how he integrates all his pockets, pearls, cuffs, fur linings, jeweled tassels, and seamless dresses into thematic unity, and maintains a consistent ideal of fashion, by constant improvisation and inventive wielding of pure line. His firework color sense finds spectacular realization in 8 full-color reproductions of <i>Harper's Bazar</i> covers, all of which are now prized collector's items. In both black-and-white and color work, his sinuous, undulating line and decorative flair never fail, and show why his fashion design has not only returned to popular favor, but is being seen in museums and galleries along with his paintings and prints. <br>Over a career spanning the century, Ert� has expressed his versatility in many forms; in these exquisite, delicate, theatrical miniatures (which will delight any lover of fashion history and graphics) he gives the very best of himself.</p><p></p><h2>Hidden Figures: The True Story of Four Black Women and the Space Race</h2><p><p><strong>Based on the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling book and the Academy Award&#x2013;nominated movie, author Margot Lee Shetterly and Coretta Scott King Illustrator Honor Award winner Laura Freeman bring the incredibly inspiring true story of four black women who helped NASA launch men into space to picture book readers!</strong></p><p>Dorothy Vaughan, Mary Jackson, Katherine Johnson, and Christine Darden were good at math...<em>really</em> good. </p><p>They participated in some of NASA's greatest successes, like providing the calculations for America's first journeys into space. And they did so during a time when being black and a woman limited what they could do. But they worked hard. They persisted. And they used their genius minds to change the world. </p><p>In this beautifully illustrated picture book edition, we explore the story of four female African American mathematicians at NASA, known as "colored computers," and how they overcame gender and racial barriers to succeed in a highly challenging STEM-based career.</p><p><strong>"Finally, the extraordinary lives of four African American women who helped NASA put the first men in space is available for picture book readers," proclaims Brightly in their article "18 Must-Read Picture Books of 2018."

Find out more about Laura at www.lfreemanart.com.</p>K-Gr 2&#x2014;Shetterly introduces young readers to the inspirational and groundbreaking stories of Dorothy Vaughan, Mary Jackson, Katherine Johnson, and Christine Darden, and their once-hidden contributions to science, aeronautics, and space exploration. Shetterly expertly puts these women's achievements in their historical context: segregation, blatant sexism and racism in the workplace, the civil rights movement, and the space race. Despite the challenges these women faced, they persisted, worked hard, and put a man on the moon. In this picture book take, the text, at times, reads a bit clinical and it's occasionally difficult to distinguish one woman's characteristics from another's while reading. This is remedied with the handy time line of short profiles in the back matter. Freeman's full-color illustrations are stunning and chock-full of details, incorporating diagrams, mathematical formulas, and space motifs throughout (including the women's clothing and jewelry), enhancing the whole book.

The Complete Personalized Promise Bible walks readers through every single promise in the Bible, from Genesis to Revelation. Carefully crafted from various translations, each promise faithfully expresses God&#39;s Word in heartfelt, personal prayer language.

Hardy discusses several historical views of work from the ancient Greeks onward, highlighting the Christian concept of <i>vocation</i> as articulated by Luther and Calvin; these expositions lead to practical applications regarding the personal issue of career choice and the important (but often neglected) social issue of job design.</p><p>Professor of philosophy at Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Michigan. He has written articles in the areas of philosophy and the theology of vocation.Hardy looks creatively at the meaning of work according to Greek, medieval, Renaissance, Marxian, and Freudian perspectives, then at Luther's view and subsequent Calvinist development and modification, concluding with contemporary Roman Catholic convergence.

The authors of the popular Left Behind series ask listeners to accept the work for what it is--a novel. Reader Robertson Dean is the best thing about the book. His measured voice and soft tones sound like the best of the narrators of the religious movies of the 1960s. His is a trustworthy voice, a fatherly voice, amazingly gentle yet harsh when necessary.

Wresting this iconic urban center from these misleading, tired clich�s, <i>The City-State of Boston</i> highlights Boston&#x2019;s overlooked past as an autonomous city-state, and in doing so, offers a pathbreaking and brilliant new history of early America. Following Boston&#x2019;s development over three centuries, Mark Peterson discusses how this self-governing Atlantic trading center began as a refuge from Britain&#x2019;s Stuart monarchs and how&#x2015;through its bargain with slavery and ratification of the Constitution&#x2015;it would tragically lose integrity and autonomy as it became incorporated into the greater United States.</p><p>Drawing from vast archives, and featuring unfamiliar figures alongside well-known ones, such as John Winthrop, Cotton Mather, and John Adams, Peterson explores Boston&#x2019;s origins in sixteenth-century utopian ideals, its founding and expansion into the hinterland of New England, and the growth of its distinctive political economy, with ties to the West Indies and southern Europe. By the 1700s, Boston was at full strength, with wide Atlantic trading circuits and cultural ties, both within and beyond Britain&#x2019;s empire. After the cataclysmic Revolutionary War, &#x201c;Bostoners&#x201d; aimed to negotiate a relationship with the American confederation, but through the next century, the new United States unraveled Boston&#x2019;s regional reign. The fateful decision to ratify the Constitution undercut its power, as Southern planters and slave owners dominated national politics and corroded the city-state&#x2019;s vision of a common good for all.</p><p>Peeling away the layers of myth surrounding a revered city, <i>The City-State of Boston</i> offers a startlingly fresh understanding of America&#x2019;s history.</p></p><p><b>Mark Peterson </b>is the Edmund S.

A blasphemer and "pretty evil feller" who "could work the hardest, eat the mostest, and tell the biggest lies." Luke's outsized feats of gambling and gluttony--he bets Society Red, a college man from Boston, that he can eat fifty eggs--and his harrowing escapes and recaptures are recounted by Dragline, who followed Luke in his last, fatal escape attempt and who basks in Luke's reflected glory. To the convicts left behind on the chain gang, Luke has become the hope of freedom and defiance that they dare not act upon themselves. Luke's refusal to "git his mind right" and submit to the sadistic discipline of the Walking Boss becomes part of their mythology of survival.</p><p><b>Donn Pearce</b> is the author of the Academy Award-nominated screenplay of <i>Cool Hand Luke</i>.

Written both for the seasoned student of philosophy as well as the general reader, the renowned writer Roger Scruton provides a survey of modern philosophy. Always engaging, Scruton takes us on a fascinating tour of the subject, from founding father Descartes to the most important and famous philosopher of the twentieth century, Ludwig Wittgenstein. He identifies all the principal figures as well as outlines of the main intellectual preoccupations that have informed western philosophy. Painting a portrait of modern philosophy that is vivid and animated, Scruton introduces us to some of the greatest philosophical problems invented in this period and pursued ever since. Including material on recent debates, <em>A Short History of Modern Philosophy</em> is already established as <em>the</em> classic introduction. Read it and find out why.</p><p><strong>Roger Scruton (1944 - ).</strong> Philosopher, author, journalist, composer and editor of the <em>Salisbury Review</em>, considered to be one of the world's leading conservative philosophers.<p><strong>'Dr Scruton writes with an unusual clarity and fluency, and is always a pleasure to read . . . this is certainly a book which you could give to anyone who was curious about philosophy and expect them to learn a lot from it.'</strong> - <em>Alan Ryan, author of Bertrand Russell: A Political Life</em></p> <p><strong>'Anyone seeking a short and intelligible introduction to the ideas and intentions of Spinoza, Hume, Kant, Hegel and Marx, among others, need look no further.'</strong> - <em>Good Book Guide</em><br></p></p><h2>The Posthuman</h2><p><p><i>The Posthuman</i> offers both an introduction and major contribution to contemporary debates on the posthuman. Digital 'second life', genetically modified food, advanced prosthetics, robotics and reproductive technologies are familiar facets of our globally linked and technologically mediated societies. This has blurred the traditional distinction between the human and its others, exposing the non-naturalistic structure of the human. <i>The Posthuman</i> starts by exploring the extent to which a post-humanist move displaces the traditional humanistic unity of the subject. Rather than perceiving this situation as a loss of cognitive and moral self-mastery, Braidotti argues that the posthuman helps us make sense of our flexible and multiple identities.<br><br>Braidotti then analyzes the escalating effects of post-anthropocentric thought, which encompass not only other species, but also the sustainability of our planet as a whole. Because contemporary market economies profit from the control and commodification of all that lives, they result in hybridization, erasing categorical distinctions between the human and other species, seeds, plants, animals and bacteria.

It develops two lines of argument. First, contemporary market economies profit from the control and commodification of all forms of life. 'Second Life', genetically modified food, advanced prosthetics, robotics and reproductive technologies are familiar facets of our globally linked and technologically mediated societies. This high degree of bio-technological development results in hybridization, erasing categorical distinctions between the human and other species, seeds, plants, animals and machines. The dislocations produced by posthuman cultures therefore make possible a critique of anthropocentrism. Post-anthropocentric politics, as exemplified by environmentalism, encompass not only other species but also the sustainability of our planet as a whole.<p>The second line of argument is concerned with the shape of contemporary philosophical debates about the human. Braidotti explores the extent to which a post-humanist perspective displaces the traditional unity and universality of the subject. Rather than perceiving this as a loss of cognitive self-mastery and ethical decency, she argues that the posthuman condition helps us make sense of, and find a new moral compass within, our globalised culture. The book concludes by providing some intellectual and ethical guidelines for the new and alternative modes of non-anthropocentric thinking that are emerging today. The challenge of the posthuman condition is to seize the opportunities for creating new forms of social bonding and community building, while pursuing economic sustainability, empowerment and social justice.</p>Rosi Braidotti is a distinguished university professor at Utrecht University and founding director of the Centre for the Humanities.</p><h2>Foreign Affairs: A Novel</h2><p>WINNER OF THE PULITZER PRIZE <br><br>Virginia Miner, a fifty-something, unmarried tenured professor, is in London to work on her new book about children&#x2019;s folk rhymes. Despite carrying a U.S. passport, Vinnie feels essentially English and rather looks down on her fellow Americans. But in spite of that, she is drawn into a mortifying and oddly satisfying affair with an Oklahoman tourist who dresses more Bronco Billy than Beau Brummel.<br><br>Also in London is Vinnie&#x2019;s colleague Fred Turner, a handsome, flat broke, newly separated, and thoroughly miserable young man trying to focus on his own research. Instead, he is distracted by a beautiful and unpredictable English actress and the world she belongs to. <br><br>Both American, both abroad, and both achingly lonely, Vinnie and Fred play out their confused alienation and dizzying romantic liaisons in Alison Lurie&#x2019;s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel.

She teaches writing, folklore, and literature at Cornell University.1<br><br> As I walked by myself<br><br> And talked to myself,<br><br> Myself said unto me,<br><br> Look to thyself,<br><br> Take care of thyself,<br><br> For nobody cares for thee.<br><br> Old Song<br><br> On a cold blowy February day a woman is boarding the ten a.m. flight to London, followed by an invisible dog. The woman&#x2019;s name is Virginia Miner: she is fifty-four years old, small, plain, and unmarried&#x2014;the sort of person that no one ever notices, though she is an Ivy League college professor who has published several books and has a well-established reputation in the expanding field of children&#x2019;s literature.<br><br> The dog that is trailing Vinnie, visible only to her imagination, is her familiar demon or demon familiar, known to her privately as Fido and representing self-pity. She visualizes him as a medium-sized dirty-white long-haired mutt, mainly Welsh terrier: sometimes trailing her silently, at other times whining and panting and nipping at her heels; when bolder, dashing round in circles trying to trip her up, or at least get her to stoop down so that he may rush at her, knock her to the ground, and cover her with sloppy kisses. Vinnie knows very well that Fido wants to get onto the plane with her, but she hopes to leave him behind, as she has successfully done on other trips abroad. Recent events, however, and the projected length of her stay, make this unlikely.<br><br> Vinnie is leaving today for six months in England on a foundation grant. There, under her professional name of V. A. Miner, she will continue her study of the folk-rhymes of schoolchildren. She has made this journey a number of times, and through a process of trial and error reduced its expense and discomfort to a minimum. She always chooses a daytime charter flight, preferring those on which no films are shown. If she could afford it, she would pay the regular fare so as to avoid boarding delays (she has already stood in various lines for nearly an hour); but that would be foolishly extravagant. Her grant is small, and she will have to watch expenses carefully as it is.<br><br> Though patience is held to be a virtue most appropriate to women, especially aging women, Vinnie has always particularly disliked waiting for anything, and never does so if it can be avoided. Now, for instance, she elbows her way deftly past less experienced passengers who are searching for their seat numbers or are encumbered with excess luggage or with children, excusing herself in a thin pleasant voice. By crossing through the galley to the far aisle and back again between two rows of seats, she outflanks a massed confusion of obvious rubes with carry-on bags labeled sun tours. In less time than it takes to read this paragraph she has made her way to a window seat near an exit in the nonsmoking section, pausing only to extract the London Times and British Vogue from a magazine rack. (Once the plane is airborne, the stewardess will distribute periodicals to all the passengers, but those Vinnie prefers may vanish before they reach her.)<br><br> Following her usual procedure, Vinnie slides into her place and unzips her boots. In stocking feet she climbs onto the seat and opens the overhead locker; since she is barely over five feet tall, this is the only way she can reach it. She removes two pillows and a loose-woven blue blanket, which she drops onto the center seat beside her handbag and her British periodicals, thus tacitly claiming this space if&#x2014;as is likely in midweek and mid-February&#x2014;it hasn&#x2019;t been assigned to anyone. Then she arranges her worn wool-lined raincoat, her floppy beige felt hat, and her amber-and-beige Liberty-print wool shawl in the locker, in such a way that only the rudest of fellow passengers will attempt to encroach upon them. She slams the locker shut with some difficulty, and sits down. She stows her boots under her own seat along with a carton of duty-free Bristol Cream sherry, and puts on a pair of folding slippers. She arranges one pillow beside her head and wedges the other between her hip and the arm of the chair. Finally she smooths her crisply cut graying hair, leans back, and with a sigh fastens the seatbelt across her tan wool sweater and skirt.<br><br> A disinterested observer, Vinnie is quite aware, might well consider these maneuvers and condemn her as self-concerned and grasping. In this culture, where energy and egotism are rewarded in the young and good-looking, plain aging women are supposed to be self-effacing, uncomplaining&#x2014;to take up as little space and breathe as little air as possible. All very well, she thinks, if you travel with someone dear to you or at least familiar: someone who will help you stow away your coat, tuck a pillow behind your head, find you a newspaper&#x2014;or if you choose, converse with you.<br><br> But what of those who travel alone? Why should Vinnie Miner, whose comfort has been disregarded by others for most of her adult life, disregard her own comfort? Why should she allow her coat, hat, and belongings to be crushed by the coats and hats and belongings of younger, larger, handsomer persons? Why should she sit alone for seven or eight hours, pillowless and chilled, reading an outdated copy of Punch, with her feet swollen and her pale amber eyes watering from the smoke of the cigarette fiends in the adjoining seats? As she often says to herself&#x2014;though never aloud, for she knows how unpleasant it would sound&#x2014;why shouldn&#x2019;t she look out for herself? Nobody else will.<br><br> But such internal arguments, frequent as they are with Vinnie, occupy little of her mind now. The uneven, uncharacteristically loud sigh she gave as she sank back against the scratchy blue plush was not a sigh of contentment, or even one of relief: it was an exhalation of wretchedness. Her travel routine has been performed by rote; if she were alone, she would break into wails of misery and vexation, and stain the London Times with her tears.<br><br> Twenty minutes ago, while waiting in the departure lounge in a cheerful mood, Vinnie read in a magazine of national circulation a scornful and disparaging reference to her life&#x2019;s work. Projects such as hers, the article stated, are a prime example of the waste of public funds, the proliferation of petty and useless scholarship, and the general weakness and folly of the humanities in America today. Do we really need a scholarly study of playground doggerel? inquired the writer, one L. D. Zimmern, a professor of English at Columbia. No doubt Mr. or Ms. Miner would answer this query by assuring us of the social, historical, or literary value of &#x201c;Ring-around-a-rosy,&#x201d; he continued, sawing through the supports of any possible answer; but he, for one, was not convinced.<br><br> What makes this unprovoked attack especially hideous is that for over thirty years the Atlantic has been Vinnie&#x2019;s favorite magazine. Though she was raised in the suburbs of New York and teaches at an upstate university, her imaginative loyalties are to New England. She has often thought that American culture took a long downward step when its hegemony passed from Boston to New York in the late nineteenth century; and it has been a comfort to her that the Atlantic continues to be edited from Back Bay. When she pictures her work receiving general public recognition, it is to this magazine that she awards the honor of discovery. She has fantasized the process often: the initial letter of inquiry, the respectfully eager manner of the interviewer, the title of the finished essay; the moment when her colleagues at Corinth University and elsewhere will open the magazine and see her name printed on its glossy pages in its characteristic and elegant typeface. (Vinnie&#x2019;s ambition, though steady and ardent, is comparatively modest: it hasn&#x2019;t occurred to her that her name might be printed upon the cover of the Atlantic.) She has imagined all that will follow: the sudden delighted smiles of her friends; the graceless grins of those who are not her friends and have undervalued both her and her subject. The latter group, alas, will be much more numerous.<br><br> For the truth is that children&#x2019;s literature is a poor relation in her department&#x2014;indeed, in most English departments: a stepdaughter grudgingly tolerated because, as in the old tales, her words are glittering jewels of a sort that attract large if not equally brilliant masses of undergraduates. Within the departmental family she sits in the chimney-corner, while her idle, ugly siblings dine at the chairman&#x2019;s table&#x2014;though, to judge by enrollment figures, many of them must spout toads and lizards.<br><br> Well, Vinnie thinks bitterly, now she has got her wish; her work has been mentioned in the Atlantic. Just her luck&#x2014;because surely there were others whose project titles might have attracted the spiteful attention of L. D. Zimmern. But of course it was she he chose, what else could she expect? Vinnie realizes that Fido has followed her onto the plane and is snuffling at her legs, but she lacks the energy to push him away.<br><br> Above her seat the warning light has been turned on; the engines begin to vibrate as if with her own internal tremor. Vinnie stares through the streaked, distorting oblong of glass at gray tarmac, pitted heaps of dirty congealed snow, other planes taxiing toward takeoff; but what she sees is a crowd of Atlantic magazines queuing for departure or already en route, singly or in squadrons, flying over the United States in the hands and briefcases of travelers, hitching their way in automobiles, loaded onto trucks and trains, bundled and tied for sale on newsstands. She visualizes what must come or has already come of this mass migration: she sees, all over the country&#x2014;in homes and offices, in libraries and dentists&#x2019; waiting rooms&#x2014;her colleagues, ex-colleagues, students, ex-students, neighbors, ex-neighbors, friends, and ex-friends (not to mention the members of the Foundation Grants Committee). All of them, at this moment or some other moment, are opening the Atlantic, turning its glossy white pages, coming upon that awful paragraph. She imagines which ones will laugh aloud; which will read the sentences out with a sneering smile; which will gasp with sympathy; and which will groan, thinking or saying how bad it looks for the Department or for the Foundation. &#x201c;Hard on Vinnie,&#x201d; one will remark. &#x201c;But you have to admit there&#x2019;s something a little comic about the title of her proposal: &#x2018;A comparative investigation of the play-rhymes of British and American Children&#x2019;&#x2014;well now, really.&#x201d;<br><br> About its title, perhaps; not about its content, as she has spent years proving. Trivial as it may seem, her material is rich in meaning. For example&#x2014;Vinnie, almost involuntarily, begins composing in her head a letter to the editor of the Atlantic&#x2014;consider the verse to which Professor Zimmern took such particular exception:<br><br> Ring around a rosy<br><br> Pocketful of posies.<br><br> Ashes, ashes,<br><br> We all fall down.<br><br> &#x2014;This rhyme appears from internal as well as external evidence to date very possibly from the Great Plague of 1665. If so, the &#x201c;posies&#x201d; may be the nosegays of flowers and herbs carried by citizens of London to ward off infection, while &#x201c;Ashes, ashes,&#x201d; perhaps refers to the burning of dead bodies that littered the streets.<br><br> &#x2014;If Professor Zimmern had troubled to do his research . . . if he had merely taken the time to inquire of any authority in the field&#x2014;Vinnie continues her imaginary letter&#x2014;he . . . he would be alive today. Unbidden, these words appear in her mind to complete the sentence. She sees L. D. Zimmern, whom she has never met but imagines (inaccurately) to be fat and bald, as a plague-swollen, discolored corpse. He is lying on the cobblestones of a seventeenth- century London alley, his clothes foully stained with vomit, his face blackened and contorted, his limbs hideously askew in the death agony, his faded posy of herbs wilting beside him.<br><br> &#x2014;Many more of these apparently &#x201c;meaningless&#x201d; verses, she resumes, a little shocked by her own imagination, have similar hidden historical and social referents, and preserve in oral form . . .<br><br> While the stewardess, in a strained BBC accent, begins her rote exhortation, Vinnie continues her letter to the editor. Phrases she has used many times in lectures and articles repeat themselves within her head, interspersed with those coming over the loudspeakers. &#x201c;Children&#x2019;s game-rhymes/Place the life vest over your head/oldest universal literature/Bring the straps to the front and fasten them securely/ representing for millions of people their earliest and often their only exposure to/Pulling on the cord will cause the vest to become inflated with air.&#x201d; Inflated with air, indeed. As she knows from bitter experience, nothing is ever gained by sending such letters. Either they are blandly refused (&#x201c;We regret that our limited space prevents . . .&#x201d;) or, worse, they are accepted and printed weeks or months later, reminding everyone of your discomfiture long after they had forgotten about it, and making you seem a sore loser.<br><br> Not only mustn&#x2019;t she write to the Atlantic: she must take care never to mention its attack on her to anyone, friend or foe. In academic life it is considered weak and undignified to complain of your reviews. Indeed, in Vinnie&#x2019;s experience, the only afflictions it is really safe to mention are those shared by all your colleagues: the weather, inflation, delinquent students, and so forth. Bad publicity must be dealt with as Vinnie was once taught by her mother to deal with flaws in her adolescent appearance: in total silence. &#x201c;If you have a spot on your face or your dress, Vinnie, for goodness&#x2019; sake don&#x2019;t mention it. At best you&#x2019;ll be reminding people of something unpleasant about yourself; at worst you&#x2019;ll call it to the attention of those who might never have noticed.&#x201d; Yes; no doubt a very sensible policy. Its only disadvantage is that Vinnie will never know who has noticed this new ugly spot and who hasn&#x2019;t. Never, never know. Fido, who has been standing with his forepaws on her knees, whining hopefully, now scrambles into her lap.<br><br> The rackety roar of the engines increases; the plane begins to trundle down the runway, gathering speed. At what seems the last possible moment it lurches unevenly upward, causing the usual shudder in Vinnie&#x2019;s bowels and the sensation of having been struck on the back of the neck with the seat-cushion. She swallows with difficulty and glances toward the window, where a frozen gray section of Long Island suburb is wheeling by at an unnatural angle. She feels queasy, disoriented, damaged. And no wonder, whines Fido: this public sneer will be in her life forever, part of her shabby history of losses and failures.<br><br> Vinnie knows, of course, that she ought not to take it so hard. But she knows too that those who have no significant identity outside their careers&#x2014;no spouse, no lover, no parents, no children&#x2014;do take such things hard. In the brief distant time when she was married, professional reverses did not damage the core of her life; they could not disrupt the comfort (or, later, the discomfort) of what went on at home. They were, so to speak, outside the plane, muffled by social insulation and the hum of the marital engines. Now these blows fall on her directly, as if the heavy oblong of glass had been removed so that Vinnie could be slapped full in the face with the Atlantic&#x2014;not the magazine, but a cold half-congealed sopping-wet arm of the ocean after which it is named, over which they are passing; slapped again and again and&#x2014;<br><br> &#x201c;Excuse me.&#x201d; It is a real voice that Vinnie now hears, the voice of the passenger in the aisle seat: a bulky, balding man in a tan Western-cut suit and rawhide tie.<br><br> &#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I just said, mind if I take a look at your newspaper?&#x201d;<br><br> Though Vinnie does mind, she is constrained by convention from saying so. &#x201c;Not at all.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d;<br>...</p><h2>The Selected Works of Edward Said, 1966 - 2006</h2><p>The renowned literary and cultural critic Edward Said was one of our era&#x2019;s most provocative and important thinkers. This comprehensive collection of his work, expanded from the earlier <i>Edward Said Reader,</i> now draws from across his entire four-decade career, including his posthumously published books, making it a definitive one-volume source.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>The Selected Works</i> includes key sections from all of Said&#x2019;s books, including his groundbreaking <i>Orientalism;</i> his memoir, <i>Out of Place</i>; and his last book, <i>On Late Style</i>. Whether writing of Zionism or Palestinian self-determination, Jane Austen or Yeats, or of music or the media, Said&#x2019;s uncompromising intelligence casts urgent light on every subject he undertakes. <i>The Selected Works</i> is a joy for the general reader and an indispensable resource for scholars in the many fields that his work has influenced and transformed.</p><p>Edward W. Said was born in 1935 in Jerusalem, raised in Jerusalem and Cairo, and educated in the United States, where he attended Princeton (B.A. 1957) and Harvard (M.A. 1960; Ph.D. 1964). In 1963, he began teaching at Columbia University, where he was University Professor of English and Comparative Literature. He died in 2003 in New York City.<br><br>He is the author of twenty-two books which have been translated into 35 languages, including <i>Orientalism</i> (1978); <i>The Question of Palestine</i> (1979); <i>Covering Islam</i> (1980); <i>The World, the Text, and the Critic</i> (1983);&nbsp;<i>Culture and Imperialism</i> (1993); <i>Peace and Its Discontents: Essays on Palestine and the Middle East Peace Process</i> (1996);&nbsp;and <i>Out of Place: A Memoir</i> (1999). Besides his academic work, he wrote a twice-monthly column for <i>Al-Hayat</i> and <i>Al-Ahram</i>; was a regular contributor to newspapers in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East; and was the music critic for <i>The Nation</i>.1<br><br>The Claims of Individuality<br><br>(1966)<br><br>&#x201c;Over the years,&#x201d; Said wrote, &#x201c;I have found myself writing about Conrad like a cantus firmus, a steady groundbass to much that I have experienced.&#x201d; There was much in Conrad&#x2019;s life with which Said identified. Conrad had grown up under the shadow of imperial occupation; he had left his native homeland during his adolescence, and he had found himself eventually living and writing in a Western European culture in which he felt neither fully at ease nor at home.<br><br>Published in 1966, Joseph Conrad and the Fiction of Autobiography was Said&#x2019;s first book, a revision of his dissertation, which he wrote at Harvard University under the direction of Monroe Engel and Harry Levin. It was, as Said wrote, &#x201c;a phenomenological exploration of Conrad&#x2019;s consciousness.&#x201d; The book drew on the literary criticism of what was known as the Geneva School, a group of literary critics centered on Georges Poulet, Jean Rousset, and Jean Starobinski. Espousing a view of literature and criticism based on the philosophies of Husserl and Merleau-Ponty, the Geneva critics held that literary works were embodiments of authorial consciousness. As J. Hillis Miller wrote, the Geneva critics saw literary criticism as the &#x201c;consciousness of consciousness.&#x201d;<br><br>In Joseph Conrad and the Fiction of Autobiography, Said undertook the colossal task of examining eight volumes of Conrad&#x2019;s letters so as to reconstruct Conrad&#x2019;s conception of his own identity, as an accomplished writer, as an �migr�, and as a Pole. Yet if Said read Conrad&#x2019;s letters to understand the vicissitudes of Conrad&#x2019;s life, he also saw his prose as the self-conscious expressions of a writer whose relationship to the English language and culture was never entirely stable.<br><br>Although the critic F. R. Leavis considered Conrad&#x2019;s prose to be marred by imprecise diction and an insufficient grasp of idiosyncratic English, Said viewed Conrad&#x2019;s relationship to the English language as an expression of Conrad&#x2019;s experience of exile. For Said, Conrad&#x2019;s writing conveyed an &#x201c;aura of dislocation, instability and strangeness.&#x201d; &#x201c;No one,&#x201d; Said later wrote, &#x201c;could represent the fate of lostness and disorientation better than [Conrad] did, and no one was more ironic about the effort of trying to replace that condition with arrangements and accommodations.&#x201d;<br><br>On November 1, 1906, having received an affectionately inscribed copy of The Mirror of the Sea from Conrad, Henry James wrote to his odd Anglo-Polish colleague: &#x201c;No one has known&#x2014;for intellectual use&#x2014;the things you know, and you have as artist of the whole matter, an authority that no one has approached.&#x201d; Conrad could scarcely have wished for more eloquent tribute to the mastery with which, in the little book of sea sketches, he had consciously mediated claims of memory and artifice. The Mirror of the Sea, however, was an agreeable item fashioned by Conrad out of what James called &#x201c;the prodigy of your past experience.&#x201d; To the casual observer&#x2014;which James was not&#x2014;Conrad&#x2019;s experience was largely a matter of ships and foreign ports, seas and storms; that, anyway, was what The Mirror of the Sea seemed to be about. Yet to Conrad, and to his fellow expatriate James speaking from a shared community of &#x201c;afflicted existence,&#x201d; experience was a spiritual struggle filling what Flaubert had called the long patience of artistic life. When in The Mirror Conrad covered his deeply felt experience with a surface that showed very little of what his life had really cost him, he was acting like Almayer, one of his characters, who in erasing his daughter&#x2019;s footsteps in the sand was denying the pain she had caused him.<br><br>Even in the best of Conrad&#x2019;s fiction there is very often a distracting surface of overrhetorical, melodramatic prose that critics like F. R. Leavis, sensitive to the precise and most efficient use of language, have severely disparaged. Yet it is not enough, I think, to criticize these imprecisions as the effusions of a writer calling attention to himself. On the contrary, Conrad was hiding himself within rhetoric, using it for his personal needs without considering the niceties of tone and style that later writers have wished he had had. He was a self-conscious foreigner writing of obscure experiences in an alien language, and he was only too aware of this. Thus his extravagant or chatty prose&#x2014;when it is most noticeable&#x2014;is the groping of an uncertain Anglo-Pole for the least awkward, most &#x201c;stylistic&#x201d; mode of expression. It is also the easiest way to conceal the embarrassments and the difficulties of an overwhelmingly untidy existence as a French-speaking, self-exiled, extremely articulate Pole, who had been a sailor and was now, for reasons not quite clear to him, a writer of so-called adventure stories. Conrad&#x2019;s prose is not the unearned prolixity of a careless writer, but rather the concrete and particular result of his immense struggle with himself. If at times he is too adjectival, it is because he failed to find a better way of making his experience clear. That failure is, in his earliest works, the true theme of his fiction. He had failed, in the putting down of words, to rescue meaning from his undisciplined experience. Nor had he rescued himself from the difficulties of his life: this is why his letters, where all of these problems are explicitly treated, are necessary to a full understanding of his fiction.<br><br>Pain and intense effort are the profound keynotes of Conrad&#x2019;s spiritual history, and his letters attest to this. There is good reason for recalling Newman&#x2019;s impassioned reminder in the Apologia that any autobiographical document (and a letter is certainly that) is not only a chronicle of states of mind, but also an attempt to render the individual energy of one&#x2019;s life. That energy has been urgently apparent, and pressing for attention ever since the publication in 1927 of Jean-Aubry&#x2019;s Joseph Conrad, Life and Letters.<br><br>The abundant difficulties with which the letters teem are, nevertheless, the difficulties of Conrad&#x2019;s spiritual life, so that critics are almost forced to associate the problems of his life with the problems of his fiction; the task here, different but related, is to see how the letters relate first to the man and then to his work. Each letter is an exercise of Conrad&#x2019;s individuality as it connects his present with his past by forging a new link of self-awareness. Taken in their available entirety, Conrad&#x2019;s letters present a slowly unfolding discovery of his mind, his temperament, his character&#x2014;a discovery, in short, that is Conrad&#x2019;s spiritual history as written by Conrad himself.<br><br>The accurate grasp of someone else&#x2019;s deepest concerns is never an easy matter. But even in the case of a writer like Conrad, whose self-concern was so intense, it is possible to view his letters in the essential, even simple, terms of their internal disposition. To cite &#x201c;pain&#x201d; and &#x201c;effort&#x201d; as hallmarks of Conrad&#x2019;s experience, for example, reveals little specifically of the man other than that he allowed himself repeated encounters with what caused pain and required effort. Yet there is a way of picturing Conrad in a characteristic and consistent stance or attitude of being, which enables us to perceive just what it was he was struggling against, and this way is to apply Richard Curle&#x2019;s wise observation that Conrad &#x201c;was absorbed . . . in the whole mechanism of existence.&#x201d; In these terms not only is it possible to apprehend the degree and kind of Conrad&#x2019;s pain and effort, but one can also discover the immediate reasons for them. Granted, of course, that Curle&#x2019;s phrase is perhaps unintentionally wise, and granted that the letters are informal and personal rather than formal or systematic, a peculiar kind of &#x201c;absorption&#x201d; is everywhere apparent in Conrad&#x2019;s letters, particularly since the existence to which he was committed was so manifestly enduring in its trials. For Conrad&#x2019;s absorption, as I understand it, was that he consciously felt a large measure of unrestful submission to the complexities of life, on the one hand and, on the other, that he remained interested in the submission not as a fait accompli but as a constantly renewed act of living, as a condition humanis�e and not as a condition humaine. &#x201c;The whole mechanism of existence&#x201d; further explains Conrad&#x2019;s preoccupations by allowing him the assumption that life itself was the total of a series of particular occurrences. Certain of these occurrences, and especially those concerning his own welfare, were connected and informed by a mechanical and perverse inevitability; nothing like cosmic optimism could be attributed to the structures of such events. He was, he felt, simply a man tortured by a finite number of intolerably fixed situations to which he seemed to return everlastingly, and this very fact had a curious pull on him. The dynamics of these persisting situations are what gripped Conrad almost from the beginning of his recorded writings to their end. And it is both the situations themselves and the way they unfold (their metaphorical expression) that the letters record in prodigious detail.<br><br>There is more to be said about this haunting phrase, &#x201c;the whole mechanism of existence.&#x201d; From Conrad&#x2019;s point of view&#x2014;for the phrase has sympathetic echoes in the letters&#x2014;it is a statement about a certain kind of conscious psychology. At first sight it is reminiscent of eighteenth-century mechanistic psychology, say of Hartley&#x2019;s theory of association and elementary determinism. To the contemporary mind, however, the phrase appeals easily to the commonplaces of the Freudian or Jungian psychologies, to the &#x201c;mechanism&#x201d; of the unconscious, to the complexes, myths, archetypes, and rituals in which each individual is somehow implicated. Yet, in his remarkable study, The Emotions: Outline of a Theory, Jean-Paul Sartre points up the inherent contradiction in a psychology confined to the unconscious. He writes there: &#x201c;It is the profound contradiction of all psychoanalysis to introduce both a bond of causality and a bond of comprehension between the phenomena which it studies. These two types of connection are incompatible.&#x201d; Sartre&#x2019;s distinction between causality and comprehension is a useful way of remarking that an analysis of a hypothetical cause does not logically make the effect comprehensible. If the unconscious can be said ultimately to determine the conscious&#x2014;and this point is not at issue&#x2014;we are hardly closer to comprehending the conscious as it presents itself to us. The literary critic is, I think, most interested in comprehension, because the critical act is first of all an act of comprehension: a particular comprehension of the written work, and not of its origins in a general theory of the unconscious. Comprehension, furthermore, is a phenomenon of consciousness, and it is in the openness of the conscious mind that critic and writer meet to engage in the act of knowing and being aware of an experience. Only that engagement, made in the interests of literary and historical fidelity, can prevent Conrad&#x2019;s remark &#x201c;I am living a nightmare&#x201d; from being accepted (or dismissed) as a hyperbolic effusion, instead of as an authentic and intense fact of experience.<br><br>As a writer, Conrad&#x2019;s job was to make intellectual use of what he had known, and &#x201c;use,&#x201d; in this Jamesian employment of the term, means rendering, making overt. It would not, furthermore, be overinterpreting James&#x2019;s compliment if I emphasize that Conrad recognized the difference between the rendering of personal experience for public consumption on one side and, on the other, for the eyes of a few close friends. Now it is precisely with this process of making experience overt and intelligible for the benefit of his intimates that Conrad&#x2019;s letters, and consequently my discussion, are concerned. First of all we should investigate the idiom of Conrad&#x2019;s rendering of his experience: the words and the images he chose to express himself. In philosophical terms, this study attempts a phenomenological exploration of Conrad&#x2019;s consciousness, so that the kind of mind he had, both in its distinction and energy, will become apparent. The great value of the letters, therefore, is that they make such a study possible by disclosing the background of speculation and insight that strengthens the fiction.<br><br>When &#x201c;knowing&#x201d; and &#x201c;knowing for intellectual use&#x201d; are spoken of in the same breath, when what is being described and the idiom of that description are taken together as an indissoluble unity, Conrad himself emerges from the letters as a significantly developing intellectual and spiritual reality. The mechanisms of existence he describes and his way of describing them are Conrad&#x2019;s very own. At his most rhetorical (and surely in this the letters often surpass the works) there is a discoverable mind working habitually, though perhaps with less energy than usual. Far more often the flurries of &#x201c;big&#x201d; words he uses&#x2014;such as life, the incomprehensible, the soul&#x2014;carry with them the proud muscularity of the European tradition of empirical morality, for the important recurring touchstone here is Conrad&#x2019;s sense of v�cu: he has lived what he describes. Often he will bring the ceaseless activity of his mind to a kind of brief nervous stop, in much the same way that a man presenting a detailed argument stops because he needs to reflect, to take stock of what he has said. Then the movement of his thought resumes. Conrad saw in certain fiction, for example, the quality of an understated simplicity whose deeper recesses, like his own during those summary stops that fill the letters, cover a vital mechanism of lived knowledge. Yet he was bothered by the elegance of a rich narrative that went forward so smoothly and at the same time withheld its inner workings. No wonder that Maupassant was a discouraging master: &#x201c;I am afraid I am too much under the influence of Maupassant. I have studied Pierre et Jean&#x2014;thought, method, and everything&#x2014;with the deepest discouragement. It seems to be nothing at all, but the mechanics are so complex that they make me tear out my hair. You want to weep with rage in reading it. That&#x2019;s a fact!&#x201d;<br><br>Despite the rhetoric, however, and the pauses it creates, to speak of Conrad&#x2019;s spiritual and intellectual reality is also to recognize a long, remarkable continuity in his abiding concerns. For this continuity, eminently Conrad&#x2019;s own, is precisely his emerging individuality, and this is the measure of his absorption in, and knowledge of, the mechanisms of existence. Conrad&#x2019;s individuality resides in a continuous exposure of his sense of himself to a sense of what is not himself: he set himself, lumpish and problematic, against the dynamic, fluid processes of life. Because of this, then, the great human appeal and distinction of Conrad&#x2019;s life is the dramatic spirit of partnership, however uneasy or indecorous, his life exemplifies, a partnership between himself and the external world. I am speaking of the full exposition of his soul to the vast panorama of existence it has discerned outside itself. He had the courage to risk a full confrontation with what, most of the time, seemed to him to be a threatening and unpleasant world. Moreover, the outcome of this dialectic is an experiencing of existential reality at that deepest level of alternative and potentiality which is the true life of the mind. Now the vocabulary and rhetoric of this experience (which I have called its idiom) is what the letters provide us with to such a degree that we are able to discover the contours of Conrad&#x2019;s mind as it engages itself in a partnership with existence.</p><h2>Desert Wisdom: Sayings from the Desert Fathers</h2><p>"As he was dying, Abba Benjamin taught his sons this: Do this, and you'll be saved: Rejoice always, pray constantly, and in all circumstances give thanks".<p>Each Christian who seeks God through prayer is continuing a tradition that began with the desert fathers and mothers of the fourth and fifth century -- simple peasants whose spiritual progress was marked by inner peace, self-control, poverty, patience, humility, and hospitality.

Bridging East and West, the simple truths of Desert Wisdom remain as fresh and vital to Christians today as they were to the disciples who first heard and recorded them.</p></p><p>Henri J. M.

Taking on the myths and misconceptions along with the outsized reality, he portrays&#x2014;with characteristic wit and passion&#x2014;a man of contagious bravery, breathtaking eloquence, matchless strategizing, and deep humanity.<br><br>Fearless on the battlefield, Churchill had to be ordered by the king to stay out of action on D-day; he pioneered aerial bombing and few could match his experience in organizing violence on a colossal scale, yet he hated war and scorned politicians who had not experienced its horrors. He was the most famous journalist of his time and perhaps the greatest orator of all time, despite a lisp and the chronic depression he kept at bay by painting. His maneuvering positioned America for entry into World War II, even as it ushered in England&#x2019;s postwar decline. His open-mindedness made him a trailblazer in health care, education, and social welfare, though he remained incorrigibly politically incorrect. Most of all, he was a rebuttal to the idea that history is the story of vast and impersonal forces; he is proof that one person&#x2014;intrepid, ingenious, determined&#x2014;can make all the difference.</p><p><b>Boris Johnson</b> is the very popular and internationally known mayor of London. Educated at Oxford, he began his career as a journalist, writing for The Times and The Telegraph (for whom he still contributes a regular column), and working his way up to editor of The Spectator. He is also the author of Johnson&#x2019;s Life of London. He was elected to the House of Commons in 2001 and served there until he was elected mayor in 2008. He lives in London with his wife and four children.<b>INTRODUCTION</b><p>A DOG CALLED CHURCHILL</p><p>When I was growing up, there was no doubt about it. Churchill was quite the greatest statesman that Britain had ever produced. From a very early age I had a pretty clear idea of what he had done: he had led my country to victory against all the odds and against one of the most disgusting tyrannies the world has seen.</p><p>I knew the essentials of his story. My brother Leo and I used to pore over Martin Gilbert&#x2019;s biographical Life in Pictures, to the point where we had memorised the captions.</p><p>I knew that he had a mastery of the art of speech-making, and my father (like many of our fathers) would recite some of his most famous lines; and I knew, even then, that this art was dying out. I knew that he was funny, and irreverent, and that even by the standards of his time he was politically incorrect.</p><p>At suppertime we were told the apocryphal stories: the one where Churchill is on the lavatory, and informed that the Lord Privy Seal wants to see him, and he says that he is sealed in the privy, etc. We knew the one where Socialist MP Bessie Braddock allegedly told him that he was drunk, and he replied, with astonishing rudeness, that she was ugly and he would be sober in the morning.</p><p>I think we also dimly knew the one about the Tory minister and the guardsman . . . You probably know it, but never mind. I had the canonical version the other day from Sir Nicholas Soames, his grandson, over lunch at the Savoy.</p><p>Even allowing for Soames&#x2019;s brilliance in storytelling, it has the ring of truth&#x2014;and tells us something about a key theme of this book: the greatness of Churchill&#x2019;s heart.</p><p>&#x2018;One of his Conservative ministers was a bugger, if you see what I mean . . .&#x2019; (said Soames, loudly enough for most of the Grill Room to hear) &#x2018;. . . though he was also a great friend of my grandfather. He was always getting caught, but of course in those days the press weren&#x2019;t everywhere, and nobody said anything. One day he pushed his luck because he was caught rogering a Guardsman on a bench in Hyde Park at three in the morning&#x2014;and it was February, by the way.</p><p>&#x2018;This was immediately reported to the Chief Whip, who rang Jock Colville, my grandfather&#x2019;s Private Secretary.</p><p>&#x2018;&#x201c;Jock,&#x201d; said the Chief Whip, &#x201c;I am afraid I have some very bad news about so-and-so. It&#x2019;s the usual thing, but the press have got it and it&#x2019;s bound to come out.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2018;&#x201c;Oh dear,&#x201d; said Colville.</p><p>&#x2018;&#x201c;I really think I should come down and tell the Prime Minister in person.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2018;&#x201c;Yes, I suppose you should.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2018;So the Chief Whip came down to Chartwell [Churchill&#x2019;s home in Kent], and he walked into my grandfather&#x2019;s study, where he was working at his upright desk. &#x201c;Yes, Chief Whip,&#x201d; he said, half turning round, &#x201c;how can I help you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2018;The Chief Whip explained the unhappy situation. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll have to go,&#x201d; he concluded.</p><p>&#x2018;There was a long pause, while Churchill puffed his cigar. Then he said: &#x201c;Did I hear you correctly in saying that so-and-so has been caught with a Guardsman?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2018;&#x201c;Yes, Prime Minister.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2018;&#x201c;In Hyde Park?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2018;&#x201c;Yes, Prime Minister.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2018;&#x201c;On a park bench?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2018;&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right, Prime Minister.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2018;&#x201c;At three o&#x2019;clock in the morning?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2018;&#x201c;That&#x2019;s correct, Prime Minister.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2018;&#x201c;In this weather! Good God, man, it makes you proud to be British!&#x201d;&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>I KNEW THAT he had been amazingly brave as a young man, and that he had killed men with his own hand, and been fired at on four continents, and that he was one of the first men to go up in an aeroplane. I knew that he had been a bit of a runt at Harrow, and that he was only about 5 feet 7 and with a 31-inch chest, and that he had overcome his stammer and his depression and his appalling father to become the greatest living Englishman.</p><p>I gathered that there was something holy and magical about him, because my grandparents kept the front page of the Daily Express from the day he died, at the age of ninety. I was pleased to have been born a year before: the more I read about him, the more proud I was to have been alive when he was alive. So it seems all the more sad and strange that today&#x2014;nearly fifty years after he died&#x2014;he is in danger of being forgotten, or at least imperfectly remembered.</p><p>The other day I was buying a cigar at an airport in a Middle Eastern country that had probably been designed by Churchill. I noticed that the cigar was called a San Antonio Churchill, and I asked the vendor at the Duty-Free whether he knew who Churchill was. He read the name carefully and I pronounced it for him.</p><p>&#x2018;Shursheel?&#x2019; he said, looking blank.</p><p>&#x2018;In the war,&#x2019; I said, &#x2018;the Second World War.&#x2019;</p><p>Then he looked as though the dimmest, faintest bell was clanking at the back of his memory.</p><p>&#x2018;An old leader?&#x2019; he asked. &#x2018;Yes, maybe, I think. I don&#x2019;t know.&#x2019; He shrugged.</p><p>Well, he is doing no worse than many kids today. Those who pay attention in class are under the impression that he was the guy who fought Hitler to rescue the Jews. But most young people&#x2014;according to a recent survey&#x2014;think that Churchill is the dog in a British insurance advertisement.</p><p>That strikes me as a shame, because he is so obviously a character that should appeal to young people today. He was eccentric, over the top, camp, with his own special trademark clothes&#x2014;and a thoroughgoing genius.</p><p>I want to try to convey some of that genius to those who might not be fully conscious of it, or who have forgotten it&#x2014;and I am of course aware that this is a bit of a cheek.</p><p>I am not a professional historian, and as a politician I am not worthy to loose the latchet of his shoes, or even the shoes of Roy Jenkins, who did a superb one-volume biography; and as a student of Churchill I sit at the feet of Martin Gilbert, Andrew Roberts, Max Hastings, Richard Toye and many others.</p><p>I am conscious that there are a hundred books a year on our hero&#x2014;and yet I am sure it is time for a new assessment, because we cannot take his reputation for granted. The soldiers of the Second World War are gradually fading away. We are losing those who can remember the sound of his voice, and I worry that we are in danger&#x2014;through sheer vagueness&#x2014;of forgetting the scale of what he did.</p><p>These days we dimly believe that the Second World War was won with Russian blood and American money; and though that is in some ways true, it is also true that, without Churchill, Hitler would almost certainly have won.</p><p>What I mean is that Nazi gains in Europe might well have been irreversible. We rightly moan today about the deficiencies of the European Union&#x2014;and yet we have forgotten about the sheer horror of that all too possible of possible worlds.</p><p>We need to remember it today, and we need to remember the ways in which this British Prime Minister helped to make the world we still live in. Across the globe&#x2014;from Europe to Russia to Africa to the Middle East&#x2014;we see traces of his shaping mind.</p><p>Churchill matters today because he saved our civilisation. And the important point is that only he could have done it.</p><p>He is the resounding human rebuttal to all Marxist historians who think history is the story of vast and impersonal economic forces. The point of the Churchill Factor is that one man can make all the difference.</p><p>Time and again in his seven decades in public life we can see the impact of his personality on the world, and on events&#x2014;far more of them than are now widely remembered.</p><p>He was crucial to the beginning of the welfare state in the early 1900s. He helped give British workers job centres and the tea break and unemployment insurance. He invented the RAF and the tank and he was absolutely critical to the action&#x2014;and Britain&#x2019;s eventual victory&#x2014;in the First World War. He was indispensable to the foundation of Israel (and other countries), not to mention the campaign for a united Europe.</p><p>At several moments he was the beaver who dammed the flow of events; and never did he affect the course of history more profoundly than in 1940.</p><p>Character is destiny, said the Greeks, and I agree. If that is so, then the deeper and more fascinating question is what makes up the character.</p><p>What were the elements that made him capable of filling that gigantic role? In what smithies did they forge that razor mind and iron will?</p><p>What the hammer, what the chain, in what furnace was his brain? as William Blake almost puts it. That&#x2019;s the question.</p><p>But first let&#x2019;s try and agree on what he did.<br><br><b>CHAPTER 1</b></p><p>THE OFFER FROM HITLER</p><p>If you are looking for one of the decisive moments in the last world war, and a turning-point in the history of the world, then come with me. Let us go to a dingy room in the House of Commons&#x2014;up some steps, through a creaky old door, down a dimly lit corridor; and here it is.</p><p>You won&#x2019;t find it on the maps of the Palace of Westminster, for obvious security reasons; and you can&#x2019;t normally get the guides to show you. In fact the precise room I am talking about doesn&#x2019;t really exist any more, since it was blown up in the Blitz; but the replacement is faithful enough to the original.</p><p>It is one of the rooms used by the Prime Minister when he or she wants to meet colleagues in the Commons, and you don&#x2019;t need to know much about the decor, because it is predictable.</p><p>Think of loads of green leather, and brass studs, and heavy coarse-grained oak panelling and Pugin wallpaper and a few prints, slightly squiffily hung. And think smoke&#x2014;because we are talking about the afternoon of 28 May 1940, and in those days many politicians&#x2014;including our subject&#x2014;were indefatigable consumers of tobacco.</p><p>It is safe to assume there wasn&#x2019;t much daylight getting through the mullioned windows, but most members of the public would easily have been able to recognise the main characters. There were seven of them in all, and they were the War Cabinet of Britain.</p><p>It is a measure of the depth of their crisis that they had been meeting almost solidly for three days. This was their ninth meeting since 26 May, and they had yet to come up with an answer to the existential question that faced them and the world.</p><p>In the chair was the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill. On one side was Neville Chamberlain, the high-collared, stiff-necked and toothbrush-moustached ex&#x2013;Prime Minister, and the man Churchill had unceremoniously replaced. Rightly or wrongly, Chamberlain was blamed for fatally underestimating the Hitler menace, and for the failure of appeasement. When the Nazis had bundled Britain out of Norway earlier that month, it was Chamberlain who took the rap.</p><p>Then there was Lord Halifax, the tall, cadaverous Foreign Secretary who had been born with a withered left hand that he concealed in a black glove. There was Archibald Sinclair, the leader of the Liberal Party that Churchill had dumped. There were Clement Attlee and Arthur Greenwood&#x2014;representatives of the Labour Party against which he had directed some of his most hysterical invective. There was the Cabinet Secretary, Sir Edward Bridges, taking notes.</p><p>The question before the meeting was very simple, and one they had been chewing over for the last few days, as the news got blacker and blacker. No one exactly spelled it out, but everyone could see what it was. Should Britain fight? Was it reasonable for young British troops to die in a war that showed every sign of being lost? Or should the British do some kind of deal that might well save hundreds of thousands of lives?</p><p>And if a deal had been done then, and the war had effectively ended with the British exit, might it have been a deal to save the lives of millions around the world?</p><p>I don&#x2019;t think many people of my generation&#x2014;let alone my children&#x2019;s generation&#x2014;are fully conscious of how close we came to it; how Britain could have discreetly, and rationally, called it quits in 1940. There were serious and influential voices who wanted to begin &#x2018;negotiations&#x2019;.</p><p>It is not hard to see why they thought as they did. The news from France was not just bad: it was unbelievably bad, and there did not seem the slightest hope that it would improve. German forces were lunging towards Paris, buffeting aside the French defences with such contemptuous ease that it really looked as if they belonged to some new military master race, pumped with superior zeal and efficiency. Hitler&#x2019;s panzers had surged not just through the Low Countries but through the supposedly impenetrable ravines of the Ardennes; the ludicrous Maginot Line had been bypassed.</p><p>The French generals cut pathetic figures&#x2014;white-haired dodderers in their Clouseau-like kepis. Every time they fell back to some new line of defence, they found that the Germans were somehow already there; and then the Stuka dive-bombers would come down like banshees and the tanks would drive on again.</p><p>The British Expeditionary Force had been cut off in a pocket around the Channel ports. They had tried briefly to counter-attack; they had been repulsed, and now they were waiting to be evacuated at Dunkirk. If Hitler had listened to his generals, he could have smashed us then: sent the ace general Guderian and his tanks into the shrinking and virtually defenceless patch of ground. He could have killed or captured the bulk of Britain&#x2019;s fighting forces, and deprived this country of the physical ability to resist.</p><p>As it was, his Luftwaffe was strafing the beaches; British troops were floating in the water face down; they were firing their Lee Enfields hopelessly at the sky; they were being chopped to bits by the dive-bombers. At that moment, on 28 May, it seemed very possible&#x2014;to generals and politicians, if not to the wider public&#x2014;that the bulk of the troops could be lost.</p><p>The War Cabinet was staring at the biggest humiliation for British armed forces since the loss of the American colonies, and there seemed no way back. It chills the marrow to look at the map of Europe as it must have appeared to that War Cabinet.</p><p>Austria had been engulfed two years earlier; Czechoslovakia was no more; Poland had been crushed; and in the last few weeks Hitler had added a shudder-making list to his portfolio of conquest. He had taken Norway&#x2014;effortlessly outwitting the British, Churchill included, who had spent months elaborating a doomed plan to pre-empt him. He had captured Denmark in little more than four hours.</p><p>Holland had surrendered; the Belgian King had pusillanimously run up the white flag at midnight the previous evening; and with every hour that went by more French forces surrendered&#x2014;sometimes after resistance of insane bravery; sometimes with a despairing and fatalistic ease.</p><p>The most important geostrategic consideration of May 1940 was that Britain&#x2014;the British Empire&#x2014;was alone. There was no realistic prospect of help, or certainly no imminent prospect. The Italians were against us. The fascist leader Mussolini had entered into a &#x2018;Pact of Steel&#x2019; with Hitler, and&#x2014;when it looked as though Hitler couldn&#x2019;t lose&#x2014;would shortly join the war on his side.</p><p>The Russians had signed the nauseating Molotov&#x2013;Ribbentrop pact, by which they had agreed to carve up Poland with the Nazis. The Americans were allergic to any more European wars, understandably: they had lost more than 56,000 men in the First World War, and more than 100,000 if you include the toll from influenza. They were offering not...</p></p><h2>More Harm Than Good (David Trevellyan Thriller)</h2><p>Don&#x2019;t mess with a tough guy with time on his hands. Especially if you have secrets to keep.

That was her, too, in the strange way the dream had of making it seem real. But the world was mostly dead; no human beings remained on it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Somehow she knew that these were two aspects of her future, and that one of them would come to pass. Marriage&#x2014;or destruction. But which one? Why? It wasn&#x2019;t frightening, just mysterious.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then music swelled. It was a lovely, mysterious melody. She woke, afraid it would fade away along with the rest of the dream, but it remained, coming from outside.<br> &nbsp;<br> She scrambled out of bed, leaving her sister Luna sleeping. Well, Luna wasn&#x2019;t exactly her sister, but it was complicated to fathom, so that was good enough. Let her sleep for the moment; this shouldn&#x2019;t take long.<br> &nbsp;<br> She shoved her toes into her slippers and scurried across the floor in her nightie. Lured by the melody, she scrambled down the stairs, along the hall, and reached the door. She put both hands up on the solid knob and turned it, and after a brief struggle got the door open.<br> &nbsp;<br> The summer dawn was cool but not cold. Orb hurried out, intent on the melody, not caring what time or temperature it was. The landscape seemed preternaturally bright, better than real life; this was fun!<br> &nbsp;<br> She paused before the house, reorienting on the sound. The farm backed onto a forest, and the sound was from the forest. She ran across the field, scattering chickens, and reached the edge of the wood, panting. She was four years old, and this was a good-sized trek for her to accomplish alone. She wasn&#x2019;t supposed to come here without an adult, and that gave her a bad twinge of unease, but the music was fading, and she knew she had to catch it right away.<br> &nbsp;<br> The forest loomed thick and dark, and it was girt with monstrous spider webs and mean brambles and other awful things, so she scouted along the edge, hoping for a way through. The music was becoming quite faint, making her desperate.<br> &nbsp;<br> She found a path! She ran down it, into the depths of the wood. But the music was now fading out entirely, to her horror. She stopped to listen for it, but it was gone.<br> &nbsp;<br> Except&#x2014;there was another sound, not the same, but possessed of its own melody. Maybe that would do. It was ahead and, as she continued along the path, it grew louder.<br> &nbsp;<br> The path debouched at the river. Orb had encountered the river before, but not at this spot. Here it was trippling merrily over rocks, making its music. She strained to hear the tune of it behind the rushing noise of water, and it came clearer, but imperfect.<br> &nbsp;<br> She made her way along its irregular bank, guided more by her ears than her eyes. Now she heard another sound, neither the first melody nor the second, but a kind of tittering laughter. It was coming from a swirling pool a little downstream.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then she spied the source of the mirth. Girls were playing in the pool! Lovely, lithe, bare girls with long tresses. They were swimming and splashing and diving and having a terrific amount of fun, and their trilling laughter made the last melody she had heard.<br> &nbsp;<br> One of the nymphs spied Orb and called out to her. &#x201c;Hello, child of man! Come join us!&#x201d; The others laughed anew at this.<br> &nbsp;<br> Orb pondered briefly, then decided to do it. She drew off her nightie and stepped out of her slippers. Naked, she went down to the pool.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;She heard me!&#x201d; the nymph exclaimed, astonished.<br> &nbsp;<br> Orb paused. &#x201c;Did I do something wrong?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The nymphs looked at each other. &#x201c;You see us, child of man?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes. Don&#x2019;t you want me to splash with you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Again they exchanged glances. &#x201c;Of course we do!&#x201d; the first nymph said. &#x201c;But do you know how to swim?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But then you might drown!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Orb hadn&#x2019;t thought of that. She was sure that drowning would be very uncomfortable. &#x201c;Then why did you ask me to join you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We didn&#x2019;t think you would hear us,&#x201d; the nymph explained.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Or see us,&#x201d; another added. &#x201c;We were only teasing, the way we do.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Because we are water sprites,&#x201d; a third said. &#x201c;The children of men aren&#x2019;t usually aware of us.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Orb was perplexed. &#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Several sprites shrugged. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t exactly know. It just is so.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> There was an instant flowering of laughter. &#x201c;Oh, you rhymed!&#x201d; another cried.<br> &nbsp;<br> The others splashed wildly at the one who had rhymed, giggling. Orb really wanted to join in, but she realized that she would have to learn to swim first.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t I hear you or see you when I saw the river before?&#x201d; she asked.<br> &nbsp;<br> The sprites looked at each other, perplexed. &#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t she?&#x201d; one repeated. &#x201c;We have seen her before, and she was oblivious.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Orb didn&#x2019;t know what the big word meant, but judged that it meant what it was supposed to. &#x201c;Yes, why?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Maybe she changed,&#x201d; one suggested. &#x201c;Did you change recently, little girl?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;This morning I heard a song I never heard before. It woke me up. I was looking for it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Again the sprites exchanged glances. &#x201c;She changed,&#x201d; they agreed. &#x201c;Now she can join us.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;How?&#x201d; Orb asked, eager to participate.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There&#x2019;s an inner tube someone&#x2019;s forgotten,&#x201d; one of the sprites informed her, perceiving her dilemma.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh, I can float in that!&#x201d; Orb agreed. &#x201c;Bring it to me!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The nymph shook her head. &#x201c;Alas, we can not,&#x201d; she said sadly.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We can not touch the things of the children of man. At least, not to affect them. Only mortal creatures can do that.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Orb accepted that. &#x201c;Then tell me where it is, and I&#x2019;ll fetch it myself.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Gladly!&#x201d; The sprite led her downstream a short distance. There, hung up on a dead branch, was an inflated inner tube.<br> &nbsp;<br> Orb waded into the shallow water, her legs tingling with the chill of it, and hauled on the tube. &#x201c;Oh, it&#x2019;s heavy,&#x201d; she complained. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you help me?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so,&#x201d; the sprite said sadly. &#x201c;I really can&#x2019;t touch you or it.&#x201d; She demonstrated by reaching out to touch Orb, and her hand passed through Orb&#x2019;s arm without sensation.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh, you&#x2019;re a ghost!&#x201d; Orb exclaimed, not certain whether to be pleased or frightened.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No, just a sprite. I can touch natural things like water, but not unnatural things like the children of man.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Orb decided it was time for introductions. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Orb,&#x201d; she announced. &#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m&#x2014;&#x201d; The sprite paused, concentrating. &#x201c;Oh, I don&#x2019;t think I have a name! I never realized.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s very sad!&#x201d; Orb said. &#x201c;I must give you a name.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh, would you?&#x201d; the sprite asked, pleased.<br> &nbsp;<br> Orb concentrated, trying to think of a name. Beads of water trailed down the tube as she continued to tug at it. &#x201c;Waterbead!&#x201d; she exclaimed.<br> &nbsp;<br> The sprite clapped her little hands. She was not much larger than Orb, though formed as an adult or nearly adult woman. &#x201c;Oh, thank you!&#x201d; Then, focusing on the tube: &#x201c;Maybe if you lifted it a little, instead of just pulling&nbsp;...&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Orb lifted&#x2014;and abruptly the tube came free. She clambered into it, and in a moment was floating.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;If you paddle with your hands&nbsp;...&#x201d; Waterbead suggested.<br> &nbsp;<br> Orb paddled, and the tube began to move. Soon she was out in the pool, moving splashily. The sprites laughed and splashed back at her. The droplets of water did touch her; they were natural. This was indeed fun, despite the cold.<br> &nbsp;<br> Waterbead swam out ahead, making little whirlpools in the water. Then the other sprites joined in, fashioning a larger whirlpool. Orb&#x2019;s tube spun around in it, making her laugh giddily. Oh, yes, this was fun!<br> &nbsp;<br> They were now at the lower side of the pool, and the current was picking up, carrying Orb on down the river. &#x201c;Maybe you should paddle upstream,&#x201d; Waterbead said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Why?&#x201d; Orb was enjoying the ride.<br> &nbsp;<br> The sprites suffered one of their little pauses. &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t go too far that way,&#x201d; one explained. &#x201c;The water goes bad.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Orb didn&#x2019;t like bad water, so she paddled. But now the current was too strong for her. She made no headway, and soon her arms were tired, and the tube picked up speed downstream.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t follow!&#x201d; a sprite cried. One by one they dropped back, returning to the quieter pool, until only Waterbead remained.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Maybe you should go to shore,&#x201d; Waterbead suggested.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Because the bad sprites are downstream. If you go to the shore, you can stop before you reach them.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Orb tried to paddle for shore, but the current fought her, and she could not reach it.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>What Should I Do with My Life?: The True Story of People Who Answered the Ultimate Question</h2><p><b>&#x201c;Brimming with stories of sacrifice, courage, commitment and, sometimes, failure, the book will support anyone pondering a major life choice or risk without force-feeding them pat solutions.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br>In&nbsp;<i>What Should I Do with My Life</i>?

His 50 vivid profiles of people searching for "their soft spot--their true calling" will engage readers because Bronson is asking himself the same question. He explores his premise, that "nothing is braver than people facing up to their own identity," as an anthropologist and autobiographer. He tackles thorny, nuanced issues about self-determination. Among them: paradoxes of money and meaning, authorship and destiny, brain candy and novelty versus soul food. Bronson&#x2019;s stories, limited to professional people and complete with photos, are gems. They include a Los Angeles lawyer who became a priest, a Harvard MBA catfish farmer turned biotech executive, and a Silicon Valley real estate agent who opened a leather crafts factory in Costa Rica.<p> Bronson is a gifted intuitive writer, the bestselling author of <i>The Nudist on the Late Shift</i>, whose thoughtful, vulnerable voice emerges as the book&#x2019;s greatest strength and challenge. He describes his subject&#x2019;s lives along with the ways they annoy, puzzle, and worry him. He frets about meddling with his questions, yet once, memorably and appropriately, he offers a talented man a top post in his publishing company. While this creates the juiciness of his portraits, it also can make Bronson the book&#x2019;s most memorable character and the only one whose story is not resolved. Even so, this remarkable career chronicle sets the gold standard for the worth of the examined life. <i>--Barbara Mackoff</i></p>In &#34;What Should I Do with My Life?

Its aim is to enable the reader to recognize, understand and date any British building. </p><p>As Matthew Rice says, "Once you can speak any language, conversation can begin, but without it communications can only be brief and brutish. The same is the case with Architecture: an inability to describe the component parts of a building leaves one tongue-tied and unable to begin to discuss what is or is not exciting, dull or peculiar about it." <i>The Language of Buildings</i> will explain the language of architecture. With it in your hand, buildings will break down beguilingly into their component parts, ready for inspection and discussion. There will be no more references to that curly bit on top of the thing with the square protrusions. Ungainly and inept descriptions will be a thing of the past and, fluent in the world of volutes, hood moulds, lobed architraves and bucrania, you will be able to leave a cathedral or country house with as much to talk about as a film or play. </p><p><i>The Language of Buildings</i> starts with an explanation of the basic "Grammar" of buildings: elevation, plan, roof, gable and eave. This will enable the reader to better make use of what is to follow. It will also cover the Orders of Architecture--Doric, Tuscan, Ionic, Corinthian and Composite--so that the vital basics of Classicism are covered. Following this is the "Vocabulary." This will be a chronological reference section covering, period by period, the windows, doors and doorcases, columns, chimneys, arches, balustrades and pediments that make up the built environment.</p></p><p><b>Matthew Rice</b> is a writer and illustrator who thought he knew lots about British architecture until he started to write and illustrate this book. His message to readers is, if you want to understand a building, sit in front of it and draw it. You might also have seen his work in <i>Country Life</i>, on his own calendar or on much of his wife Emma Bridgewater's pottery. He lives in Oxford and Norfolk.</p><h2>Leadership In The Crucible of Work: Discovering the Interior Life of an Authentic Leader (AdventHealth Press)</h2><p>What is the First and Most Important Work of a Leader? (The answer may surprise you)<p>In Leadership in the Crucible of Work, noted speaker, poet, and college president Dr. Sandy Shugart takes readers on an unforgettable journey to the heart of what it means to become an authentic leader. A leader who understands that work forms each of us more powerfully than we form it. A leader willing to be purified and shaped, like bronze, in the crucible of work. A leader who stands ready to do the first and most important work of a leader the interior work.</p><p>In these pages Dr. Shugart has crafted a different kind of leadership guide. Not a how-to book packed with the latest management theories, formulas, or processes, but a thoughtful collection of essays with questions, reflections, and stories on developing the indispensable inner life of a leader.</p><p> In this Book You Will:</p><p>- Discover inner attitudes that lead to the outer actions of a great leader.</p><p>- Understand the importance of asking good questions because every good question directs a leader to a better one.</p><p>- Learn how an exceptional leader says, we are in this together, then demonstrates it to be true. </p><p>- Find out why the greatest threat to a leader is their own ego, hubris, and blind spots and what to do about it.</p><p>- Come to realize that the difficult experiences of work (i.e. the crucible) exist to consume the dross of self so the leader is humbly drawn into servant leadership.</p><p>- Uncover how to become the unique leader you were meant to be.</p><p>- Find encouragement and guidance to shape your inward journey as you become an outwardly successful, authentic leader</p><p>Dr. Sandy Shugart was quickly advancing in his career. At the age of 25 he found himself as a senior leader in a large billion-dollar organization. As he became immersed in the competitive, power-laden politics of modern bureaucracy, something important happened; he wounded a colleague. As a result, he realized he was becoming someone he didn't want to be. And it was happening at work. </p><p> In a rare flash of insight, he writes, I realized that the jerks-the old burned-out, negative, manipulating, officious, self-centered bureaucrats about whom we all made jokes-had started out just like me. They hadn't always been jerks.</p><p> What is it that causes a leader to go bad? Or to become good? Is it the organizational environment? Is it the stress of the job? </p><p> For leaders living in an imperfect, broken world, work turns out to be a kind of crucible. A place where they experience the heat, pressure, and corrosion of elevated responsibility. For most of us, the crucible of work is unavoidable. So the question becomes, how do we endure the crucible without being hopelessly deformed by it? Or, how can we use the crucible to form us into a more valuable and authentic leader? </p><p> In Leadership in the Crucible of Work: Discovering the Interior Life of an Authentic Leader, Dr. Shugart shares insights from his 30 years of experience as a leader, including his service as the president of Valencia College - inaugural winner of the Aspen Prize for Excellence. Avoiding the latest leadership gimmicks and fads, Leadership in the Crucible of Work will guide you on an inward journey to discover how to do the interior work that leads to becoming an authentic leader.</p></p><p>Sandy Shugart, PhD, stumbled into a senior leadership at a very early age and found himself in the deep end, with sharks. As vice president of a billion dollar higher education system and twenty years the junior of any of his colleagues and staff, he was compelled to learn to lead in a hurry. What he discovered was a powerful interaction between the challenges of his work as a leader and the formation of his character.<p> Dr. Shugart's leadership journey took him on to presidencies of two large colleges, an active life of speaking on these issues in the US and Europe, a visiting scholars chair at Oxford University, and various boards of directors. In all of these roles, he has been in the laboratory of leadership, in the crucible of pressure, heat, and re-activity that defines modern organizational life and acts powerfully to form or to deform the deep character of the leader and the led. </p><p> His reflections on these experiences have informed his own leadership roles, his poetry, and his music for many years. Most of all, he is a storyteller, sharing with good humor and humility the inner struggles he and many other leaders confront every day.</p></p><h2>Statistics and Probability with Applications (High School)</h2><p><p>Written specifically for high school students, <em>Statistics and Probability with Applications</em> helps you stay on track in the course with lively real-life examples which prepare you to use statistics in college courses and in any career.</p><br><p></p></p><p></p><h2>Bluestocking Guide: Solving the Money Mystery (A Bluestocking Guide)</h2><p>"A Bluestocking Guide: Solving the Money Mystery" is designed to reinforce and enhance a student's understanding of the subject matter presented in the primer "The Money Mystery" an Uncle Eric book by Richard J. Maybury. Comprehension Questions are given for each chapter and may include Definition, True/False, and/or Short Answer/Fill-in questions. Answers are located in the back of the study guide. &nbsp;(Note: student answers to some questions/exercises do not always have definitive answers, in which case the notation "answers will vary" will appear.) Application Exercises are also given. Generally, these ask the student to apply the knowledge he/she learned from a given chapter to "real world" situations so that the student may personalize the information and better retain and apply the knowledge gained from the primer. &nbsp;Application Exercises typically include Discussion, Essay, and Research assignments. A comprehensive final exam is also included. In addition to assisting the student in the retention of the subject matter, the study guide will serve as documentation of course completion. Timeframe for Study: Bluestocking Guides are organized to allow the instructor flexibility in designing the ideal course of study for the student. Therefore, there is no "right" or "wrong" timeframe for covering the material; the instructor should tailor the study of the primer and study guide to the student's unique school schedule, learning style and age. For example, younger students might only complete comprehension exercises in the study guide, whereas older students may complete additional application exercises and suggestions for further reading/study. Ideally, the student should read the chapter from the primer and then immediately answer the corresponding questions in the study guide. For Essay and Research assignments, a project may require several days or weeks to complete. It is best that the instructor preview these assignments to select those most appropriate for the student and the timeframe available. An easy-to-apply rule of thumb for determining length of study is to divide the number of chapters in a primer by the number of weeks the instructor plans to study the subject/book. &nbsp;Some instructors may choose to complete the primer in a few short weeks, in which case multiple chapters may need to be covered for each lesson period. &nbsp;Others may cover the primer over the course of a semester, in which case only one or two chapters per week will need to be assigned. (Note: &nbsp;Chapter lengths vary, so sometimes a student may easily be able to read more than one chapter per lesson.) &nbsp;The key is to move quickly enough so that the student is engaged with learning and also able to absorb all concepts fully. The student's performance on end-of-chapter Questions and Assignments from the study guide should be a good indication of this. This guide is 8-1/2" x 11" in size.<br><br>Description of the primer, "The Money Mystery": During the 1980s the velocity of circulation of the dollar became erratic; now the whole country is affected. The Money Mystery explains why Federal Reserve officials remain so afraid of inflation, explains precautions you should take, and explains the wild swings in the stock market. Few analysts understand what velocity is doing to the economy. Learn what you can do about it. This new third edition includes an all new chapter titled A New, or Very Old, Form of Inflation. Like all the Uncle Eric books, "The Money Mystery" was written to be able to stand alone. &nbsp;Please note, however, that "The Money Mystery" is the first sequel to "Whatever Happened to Penny Candy". "The Clipper Ship Strategy" is the second sequel to "Whatever Happened to Penny Candy."</p><p>Kathryn Daniels was born in Sacramento, California.

It has little to do with the rigid daily calendar diary you may have kept as a child or the factual travelogue you wrote to recall the Grand Canyon. Instead, it is a tool for tapping the full power of your inner resources.<br><br><b>The New Diary</b> is as much for those who already keep a journal as it is for those who have never kept one. It does not tell you the "right" way to keep a diary; rather, it offers numerous possibilities for using the diary to achieve your own purposes. It is a place for you to clarify goals, visualize the future, and focus your engergies; a means of freeing your intuition and imagination; a workbook for exploring your dreams, your past, and your present life. <br><br>It is for everyone seeking concrete methods for dealing with personal problems. It is for women and men interested in achieving self-reliance and inner liberation, for artists and writers seeking new techniques for overcoming blocks to creativity.</p><p><b>Tristine Rainer</b> is the director of the Center for Autobiographic Studies in Pasadena, California.

In <i>Seduction of a Highland Lass,</i> an indomitable Highland warrior is caught between loyalty and forbidden love.</b><br></b>&nbsp;<br>Fiercely loyal to his elder brother, Alaric McCabe leads his clan in the fight for their birthright. Now he is prepared to wed for duty, as well. But on his way to claim the hand of Rionna McDonald, daughter of a neighboring chieftain, he is ambushed and left for dead.

She lives in Texas with her husband, three children, and an assortment of pets.Chapter 1<br><br>Alaric McCabe looked out over the expanse of McCabe land and grappled with the indecision plaguing him. He breathed in the chilly air and looked skyward. It wouldn&#x2019;t snow this day. But soon. Autumn had settled over the highlands. Colder air and shorter days had pushed in.<br><br>After so many years of struggling to eke out an existence, to rebuild their clan, his brother Ewan had made great strides in restoring the McCabes to their former glory. This winter, their clan wouldn&#x2019;t go hungry. Their children wouldn&#x2019;t go without proper clothing.<br><br>Now it was time for Alaric to do his part for his clan. In a short time, he would travel to the McDonald holding where he would formally ask for Rionna McDonald&#x2019;s hand in marriage.<br><br>It was pure ceremony. The agreement had been struck weeks earlier. Now the aging laird wanted Alaric to spend time among the McDonalds, a clan that would one day become Alaric&#x2019;s when he married McDonald&#x2019;s daughter and only heir.<br><br>Even now the courtyard was alive with activity as a contingent of McCabe soldiers readied to make the journey with Alaric.<br><br>Ewan, Alaric&#x2019;s older brother and laird of the McCabe clan, had wanted to send his most trusted men to accompany Alaric on his journey, but Alaric refused. There was still danger to Ewan&#x2019;s wife, Mairin, who was heavily pregnant with Ewan&#x2019;s child.<br><br>As long as Duncan Cameron was alive, he posed a threat to the McCabes. He coveted what was Ewan&#x2019;s&#x2014;�Ewan&#x2019;s wife and Ewan&#x2019;s eventual control of Neamh �lainn, a legacy brought through his marriage to Mairin, the daughter of the former king of Scotland.<br><br>And now because of the tenuous peace in the highlands and the threat Duncan Cameron posed not only to the neighboring clans, but to King David&#x2019;s throne, Alaric agreed to the marriage that would cement an alliance between the McCabes and the only clan whose lands rested between Neamh �lainn and McCabe land.<br><br>It was a good match. Rionna McDonald was fair to look upon, even if she was an odd lass who preferred the dress and duties of a man over those of a woman. And Alaric would have what he&#x2019;d never have if he remained under Ewan: his own clan to lead. His own lands. His heir inheriting the mantle of leadership.<br><br>So why wasn&#x2019;t he more eager to mount his horse and ride toward his destiny?<br><br>He turned when he heard a sound to his left. Mairin McCabe was hurrying up the hillside, or at least attempting to hurry, and Cormac, her assigned guard for the day looked exasperated as he followed in her wake. Her shawl was wrapped tightly around her, and her lips trembled with the cold.<br><br>Alaric held out his hand, and she gripped it, leaning toward him as she sought to catch her breath.<br><br>&#x201c;You shouldn&#x2019;t be up here, lass,&#x201d; Alaric reproached. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to freeze to death.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nay, she shouldn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Cormac agreed. &#x201c;If our laird finds out, he&#x2019;ll be angry.&#x201d;<br><br>Mairin rolled her eyes and then looked anxiously up at Alaric. &#x201c;Do you have everything you require for your journey?&#x201d;<br><br>Alaric smiled. &#x201c;Aye, I do. Gertie has packed enough food for a journey twice as long.&#x201d;<br><br>She alternated squeezing and patting Alaric&#x2019;s hand, her eyes troubled as she rubbed her burgeoning belly with her other hand. He pulled her closer so she&#x2019;d have the warmth of his body.<br><br>&#x201c;Should you perchance wait another day? It&#x2019;s near to noon already. Maybe you should wait and leave early on the morrow.&#x201d;<br><br>Alaric stifled his grin. Mairin wasn&#x2019;t happy with his leaving. She was quite used to having her clan right where she wanted them. On McCabe land. And now that Alaric was set to leave, she&#x2019;d become increasingly more vocal in her worry and her dissatisfaction.<br><br>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t be gone overlong, Mairin,&#x201d; he said gently. &#x201c;A few weeks at most. Then I&#x2019;ll return for a time before the marriage takes place and I reside permanently at McDonald keep.&#x201d;<br><br>Her lips turned down into an unhappy frown at the reminder that Alaric would leave the McCabes and, for all practical purposes, become a McDonald.<br><br>&#x201c;Stop frowning, lass. It isn&#x2019;t good for the babe. Neither is you being out here in the cold.&#x201d;<br><br>She sighed and threw her arms around him. He took a step back and exchanged amused glances with Cormac over her head. The lass was even more emotional now that she was swollen with child, and the members of her clan were becoming increasingly more familiar with her spontaneous bursts of affection.<br><br>&#x201c;I shall miss you, Alaric. I know Ewan will as well. He says nothing, but he&#x2019;s quieter now.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll miss you, too,&#x201d; Alaric said solemnly. &#x201c;Rest assured, I&#x2019;ll be here when you deliver the newest McCabe.&#x201d;<br><br>At that, her face lit up and she took a step back and reached up to pat him on the cheek.<br><br>&#x201c;Be good to Rionna, Alaric. I know you and Ewan feel she needs a firmer hand, but in truth, I think what she most needs is love and acceptance.&#x201d;<br><br>Alaric fidgeted, appalled that she&#x2019;d want to discuss matters of love with him. For God&#x2019;s sake.<br><br>She laughed. &#x201c;All right. I can see I&#x2019;ve made you uncomfortable. But heed my words.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My lady, the laird has spotted you and he doesn&#x2019;t look pleased,&#x201d; Cormac said.<br><br>Alaric turned to see Ewan standing in the courtyard, arms crossed over his chest and a scowl etched onto his face.<br><br>&#x201c;Come along, Mairin,&#x201d; Alaric said as he tucked her hand underneath his arm. &#x201c;I better return you to my brother before he comes after you.&#x201d;<br><br>Mairin grumbled under her breath, but she allowed Alaric to escort her down the hillside.<br><br>When they reached the courtyard, Ewan leveled a glare at his wife but turned his attention to Alaric. &#x201c;Do you have all you need?&#x201d;<br><br>Alaric nodded.<br><br>Caelen, the youngest McCabe brother, came to stand at Ewan&#x2019;s side. &#x201c;Are you sure you don&#x2019;t want me to accompany you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re needed here,&#x201d; Alaric said. &#x201c;More so as Mairin&#x2019;s time draws nigh. Winter snows will be upon us soon. It would be just like Duncan to mount an attack when he thinks we least expect it.&#x201d;<br><br>Mairin shivered at Alaric&#x2019;s side again, and he turned to her. &#x201c;Give me a hug, sister, and then go back into the keep before you catch your death of cold. My men are ready, and I won&#x2019;t have you crying all over us as we try to leave.&#x201d;<br><br>As expected, Mairin scowled but once again threw her arms around Alaric and squeezed tight.<br><br>&#x201c;God be with you,&#x201d; she whispered.<br><br>Alaric rubbed an affectionate hand over her hair and then pushed her in the direction of the keep. Ewan reinforced Alaric&#x2019;s dictate with a ferocious scowl of his own.<br><br>Mairin stuck her tongue out and then turned away, Cormac following her toward the steps of the keep.<br><br>&#x201c;If you have need of me, send word,&#x201d; Ewan said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll come immediately.&#x201d;<br><br>Alaric gripped Ewan&#x2019;s arm and the two brothers stared at each other for a long moment before Alaric released him. Caelen pounded Alaric on the back as Alaric went to mount his horse.<br><br>&#x201c;This is a good thing for you,&#x201d; Caelen said sincerely once Alaric was astride his horse.<br><br>Alaric stared down at his brother and felt the first stirring of satisfaction. &#x201c;Aye, it is.&#x201d;<br><br>He took a deep breath as his hands tightened on the reins. His lands. His clan. He&#x2019;d be laird. Aye, this was a good thing.<br><br>Alaric and a dozen of the McCabe soldiers rode at a steady pace throughout the day. Since they&#x2019;d gained a late start, what would normally be a day&#x2019;s ride would now require them to arrive on McDonald&#x2019;s land the next morning.<br><br>Knowing this, Alaric didn&#x2019;t press, and actually halted his men to make camp just after dusk. They built only one fire and kept the blaze low so it didn&#x2019;t illuminate a wide area.<br><br>After they&#x2019;d eaten the food that Gertie had prepared for the journey, Alaric divided his men into two groups and told the first of the six men to take the first watch.<br><br>They stationed themselves around the encampment, providing protection for the remaining six to bed down for a few hours&#x2019; rest.<br><br>Though Alaric was scheduled for the second watch, he couldn&#x2019;t sleep. He lay awake on the hard ground, staring up at the star-�filled sky. It was a clear night and cold. The winds were picking up from the north, heralding a coming change in the weather.<br><br>Married. To Rionna McDonald. He tried hard but could barely conjure an image of the lass. All he could remember was her vibrant golden hair. She was quiet, which he supposed was a good trait for a woman to have, although Mairin was hardly a quiet or particularly obedient wife. And yet he found her endearing, and he knew that Ewan wouldn&#x2019;t change a single thing about her.<br><br>But then Mairin was all a woman should be. Soft and sweet, and Rionna was mannish in both dress and manner. She wasn&#x2019;t an unattractive lass, which made it puzzling that she would indulge in activities completely unsuitable for a lady.<br><br>It was something he&#x2019;d have to address immediately.<br><br>A slight disturbance of the air was the only warning he had before he lunged to the side. A sword caught his side, slicing through clothing and flesh.<br><br>Pain seared through his body, but he pushed it aside as he grabbed his sword and bolted to his feet. His men came alive and the night air swelled with the sounds of battle.<br><br>Alaric fought two men, the clang of swords blistering his ears. His hands vibrated from the repeated blows as he parried and thrust.<br><br>He was backed toward the perimeter set by his men and nearly tripped over one of the men he&#x2019;d posted as guard. An arrow protruded from his chest, a testimony to how stealthily the ambush had been set.<br><br>They were sorely outnumbered, and although Alaric would pit the McCabe soldiers against anyone, anytime, and be assured of the outcome, his only choice was to call a retreat lest they all be slaughtered. There was simply no way to win against six-�to-�one odds.</p><h2>The Lawrence Browne Affair</h2><p><p><em>An earl hiding from his future . . . </em></p><p>Lawrence Browne, the Earl of Radnor, is mad.

Unlike these magnificent predators, humans have donned this distinctive animal pattern to be noticed; leopard print demands an audience. Jo Weldon, an expert in the world of burlesque, reveals how this sexy, playful, decadent, and vibrant pattern once reserved for royalty came into vogue and became a staple of fashion.</p><p>With the revolution in technology and the rise of mass production in the early 1900s, textiles could be produced quickly and inexpensively, transforming every industry. Couture experienced a creative awakening: colors, prints, and patterns never seen before became ubiquitous. A greater freedom of choice in ready-to-wear clothing gave women the opportunity to express themselves in new styles. From its inception in textile, leopard print&#x2014;long used as a symbol of a warrior&#x2019;s power or a ruler&#x2019;s wealth&#x2014;became a sensation, adopted by daring trendsetters and members of the avant-garde, including film stars and celebrities such as Carole Lombard and Josephine Baker, who walked her pet Cheetah, Chiquita, on a diamond-encrusted leash. The desire for leopard print continues today as Nicki Minaj, Rihanna and other stars flaunt their feline-inspired spots on film and stage, the catwalk and the red carpet.</p><p>With a lively narrative, informative sidebars, and stunning images, <em>Fierce</em> is a must have collection for designers and fashionistas of all kinds.</p></p><p><p>Jo Weldon is an expert in the study of contemporary burlesque, women&#x2019;s issues, and fashion. Her writings and transcripts of lectures on the history of leopard print have been published in <em>Mental Floss, Time Out New York,</em> and the <em>New York Times</em>. As headmistress of the New York School of Burlesque, she teaches weekly classes and tours internationally, teaching and performing. Weldon combines years of professional experience as an adult entertainer with a deep understanding of women&#x2019;s issues. She has presented media analyses of women&#x2019;s rights in conferences around the country and lobbied at the U.N. for inclusion of diverse perspectives in human rights initiatives. She lives in New York City.

He introduces the reader to communal architecture--architecture produced not by specialists but by the spontaneous and continuing activity of a whole people with a common heritage, acting within a community experience. A prehistoric theater district for a hundred thousand spectators on the American continent and underground towns and villages (complete with schools, offices, and factories) inhabited by millions of people are among the unexpected phenomena he brings to light.</p><p>The beauty of "primitive" architecture has often been dismissed as accidental, but today we recognize in it an art form that has resulted from human intelligence applied to uniquely human modes of life. Indeed, Rudofsky sees the philosophy and practical knowledge of the untutored builders as untapped sources of inspiration for industrial man trapped in his chaotic cities.</p></p><p>A unique examination of building and culture.</p><h2>Celia Garth (11) (Rediscovered Classics)</h2><p><p>Bringing to life the heady days of the American Revolution through the eyes of a heroine who played a brave and dramatic part in the conflict, this novel follows Celia Garth, a Charleston native, as she transforms from a fashionable dressmaker to a patriot spy. When the king's army captures Charleston and sweeps through the Carolina countryside in a wave of blood, fire, and debauchery, the rebel cause seems all but lost. But when Francis Marion, a lieutenant colonel in the Continental Army known as "The Swamp Fox," recruits Celia as a spy, the tides of war begin to shift. This classic historical novel captures the fervor of 18th-century Charleston, the American Revolution, and a woman who risked her life for the patriot cause. </p></p><p><strong>Gwen Bristow&nbsp;was the author of <i>Calico Palace</i>,<i> Golden Dreams</i>,<i> Jubilee Trail</i>,<i> This Side of Glory</i>, and <i>Tomorrow Is Forever.</i> <strong>Sara Donati is the author of <i>Dawn on a Distant Shore</i>,<i> Fire Along the Sky</i>,<i> Into the Wilderness</i>,<i> Lake in the Clouds</i>, and <i>Queen of Swords</i>.</strong></strong></p><h2>Raiders from New France: North American Forest Warfare Tactics, 17th&#x2013;18th Centuries (Elite)</h2><p><p><b>Supported by full-color illustrations, this study explores in startling new detail the &#x201c;musket and tomahawk&#x201d; forest warfare by which the French colonists and their allies battled to ensure the survival of &#x201c;New France.&#x201d;</b></p><p>Though the French and British colonies in North America began on a &#x201c;level playing field," French political conservatism and limited investment allowed the British colonies to forge ahead, pushing into territories that the French had explored deeply but failed to exploit.

Her art flourished in small settings, as can be seen in her bestselling novel <i>The Summer Book</i> and in her internationally celebrated cartoon strips and books about the Moomins. It is only natural, then, that throughout her life she turned again and again to the short story. <i>The Woman Who Borrowed Memories</i> is the first extensive selection of Jansson&#x2019;s stories to appear in English. <br><br>Many of the stories collected here are pure Jansson, touching on island solitude and the dangerous pull of the artistic impulse: in &#x201c;The Squirrel&#x201d; the equanimity of the only inhabitant of a remote island is thrown by a visitor, in &#x201c;The Summer Child&#x201d; an unlovable boy is marooned along with his lively host family, in &#x201c;The Cartoonist&#x201d; an artist takes over a comic strip that has run for decades, and in &#x201c;The Doll&#x2019;s House&#x201d; a man&#x2019;s hobby threatens to overwhelm his life. Others explore unexpected territory: &#x201c;Shopping&#x201d; has a post-apocalyptic setting, &#x201c;The Locomotive&#x201d; centers on a railway-obsessed loner with murderous fantasies, and &#x201c;The Woman Who Borrowed Memories&#x201d; presents a case of disturbing transference. Unsentimental, yet always humane, Jansson&#x2019;s stories complement and enlarge our understanding of a singular figure in world literature.</p><p><b>Tove Jansson</b> (1914&#x2013;2001) was born in Helsinki into Finland&#x2019;s Swedish-speaking minority. Her father was a sculptor and her mother a graphic designer and illustrator. Winters were spent in the family&#x2019;s art-filled studio and summers in a fisherman&#x2019;s cottage in the Pellinge archipelago, a setting that would later figure in Jansson&#x2019;s writing for adults and children. Jansson loved books as a child and set out from an early age to be an artist. Her first illustration was published when she was fifteen years old; four years later a picture book appeared under a pseudonym. After attending art schools in both Stockholm and Paris, she returned to Helsinki, where in the 1940s and &#x2019;50s she won acclaim for her paintings and murals. From 1929 until 1953 Jansson drew humorous illustrations and political cartoons for the left-leaning anti-Fascist Finnish-Swedish magazine <i>Garm</i>, and it was there that what was to become Jansson&#x2019;s most famous creation, Moomintroll, a hippopotamus-like character with a dreamy disposition, made his first appearance. Jansson went on to write about the adventures of Moomintroll, the Moomin family, and their curious friends in a long-running comic strip and in a series of books for children that have been translated throughout the world, inspiring films, several television series, an opera, and theme parks in Finland and Japan. Jansson also wrote eleven novels and short-story collections for adults, including <i>The Summer Book</i>, <i>The True Deceiver</i>, <i>Fair Play</i>, and <i>The Woman Who Borrowed Memories </i>(available as NYRB Classics). In 1994 she was awarded the Prize of the Swedish Academy. Jansson and her companion, the artist Tuulikki Pietil�, continued to live part time in a cottage on the remote outer edge of Pellinge until 1991.<br><br><b>Thomas Teal</b> has translated many of Tove Jansson&#x2019;s works into English, beginning in the 1970s with <i>The Summer Book </i>and <i>Sun City </i>and more recently, <i>The True Deceiver</i> (2009, winner of the Best Translated Book Award) and<i> Fair Play</i> (2011, winner of the Bernard Shaw Prize for translation from the Swedish).

It was (and remains) the most comprehensive, systematic, forthright, and powerful defense of the economics of liberty ever written. This is the Scholars Edition: accept no substitute.

It invariably deals with the interconnectedness of all phenomena of acting and economizing. All economic facts mutually condition one another. Each of the various economic problems must be dealt with in the frame of a comprehensive system assigning its due place and weight to every aspect of human wants and desires. All monographs remain fragmentary if not integrated into a systematic treatment of the whole body of social and economic relations. <p>To provide such a comprehensive analysis is the task of my book <i>Human Action </i>, a Treatise on Economics. It is the consummation of lifelong studies and investigations, the precipitate of half a century of experience. I saw the forces operating which could not but annihilate the high civilization and prosperity of Europe. In writing my book, I was hoping to contribute to the endeavors of our most eminent contemporaries to prevent this country from following the path which leads to the abyss.</p></blockquote> <p>The Scholars Edition of <i>Human Action</i> is the definitive edition of this great work and foundation of every library of freedom. </p></p><p></p><h2>Bismarck: A Life</h2><p>This riveting, <em>New York Times</em> bestselling biography illuminates the life of Otto von Bismarck, the statesman who unified Germany but who also embodied everything brutal and ruthless about Prussian culture. <br><br>Jonathan Steinberg draws heavily on contemporary writings, allowing Bismarck's friends and foes to tell the story. What rises from these pages is a complex giant of a man: a hypochondriac with the constitution of an ox, a brutal tyrant who could easily shed tears, a convert to an extreme form of evangelical Protestantism who secularized schools and introduced civil divorce. Bismarck may have been in sheer ability the most intelligent man to direct a great state in modern times. His brilliance and insight dazzled his contemporaries. But all agreed there was also something demonic, diabolical, and overwhelming in Bismarck's personality. He was a kind of malign genius who, behind the various postures, concealed an ice-cold contempt for his fellow human beings and a drive to control and rule them. As one contemporary noted: "the Bismarck regime was a constant orgy of scorn and abuse of mankind, collectively and individually." <br> <br>A brilliant study in power, this comprehensive biography brings Bismarck to life, revealing the stark contrast between the "Iron Chancellor's" unmatched political skills and his profoundly flawed human character.<br></p><p><br><strong>Jonathan Steinberg</strong> is the Walter H. Annenberg Professor of Modern European History at the University of Pennsylvania, and Emeritus Fellow, Trinity Hall, Cambridge. His books include <em>Yesterday's Deterrent: Tirpitz and the Birth of the German Battle Fleet</em> and <em>All or Nothing: The Axis and the Holocaust</em> <em>1941 - 1943</em>.<br><br>"...<em>Bismarck: A Life</em> is the best study of its subject in the English language." -- Henry A. Kissinger, <em>New York Times Book Review</em> <br><p></p><br>"Fascinating biography...Mr. Steinberg breathes more life into Bismarck than any other biographer, thanks to an unusual scholarly method: He shifts the normal balance between analysis and evidence decisively in favor of the latter...The result is riveting, and we experience Bismarck as a hulking, breathing presence." --<em>The Wall Street Journal</em> <br><p></p><br><em>The Wall Street Journal</em> "Book of the Year" selection ("[T]he best biography of the Iron Chancellor to date." --Simon Sebag Montefiore) <br><p></p><br>"A first-rate biography that combines a standard historical narrative with an intriguing account of Bismarck as a personality...Bismarck offers a fresh and compelling portrait of a fascinating character." -- <em>ForeignAffairs.com</em><p></p><br>"<em>Bismarck: A Life</em> is a readable, engrossing...biography about the father of the Fatherland, a man who made Germany and remade Europe without a mandate, a crown or an army." -- <em>Dallas Morning News</em><p></p><br>"This is the best one-volume life of Bismarck in English, much superior to older works. It brings us close to this galvanic, contradictory and ultimately self-destructive figure...Steinberg has an eye for details...and a talent for reconstructing the political drama of the period."-- <em>The</em> <em>Guardian</em><p></p><br>"Steinberg...brings a fresh perspective to the subject in a single volume whose insights and presentation make it no less canonical than its predecessors." --<em>Publishers Weekly, Starred Review</em> <br><p></p><br>"Jonathan Steinberg's magnificent biography brings out the monstrous egotism of Bismarck more clearly than anyone before him...Steinberg has brilliantly transformed this man of 'blood and irony' into a tragic figure worthy to be compared with Goethe's Faust." -- <em>New Criterion</em> <br><p></p><br>"The Bismarck story is an oft-told one, and oft-told with a political or social agenda guiding the biographer's pen. Otto Pflanze's magisterial 1990 three-volume work set a new standard for Bismarck biographies and, more recently, Edgar Feuchtwanger's 'Imperial Germany 1850-1918' moved us beyond the standard Bismarck mythology. Jonathan Steinberg's 'Bismarck: A Life' fits neatly into this estimable body of work as a serious, politically detached, study...Steinberg's analysis achieves a degree of personal and political objectivity while avoiding an oversimplification of his political and governmental achievements...his purpose is neither to praise nor vilify the statesman. Rather, he aims to understand and explain Bismarck's profound success story: his brilliant strategies and tactics in bringing together the German states into a unified polity. In this, 'Bismarck: A Life' is a success story itself." -- <em>Forward</em> <br> <br><p></p><br>"Portrays a fascinating picture of Germany, as well as its culture and politics...Jonathan Steinberg's biography is timely and necessary...Steinberg has written a compelling, readable and important book." -- <em>Jerusalem Post</em> <br><p></p><br>"If scholars and history buffs want to meet Bismarck in flesh and blood, they need go no further. Steinberg's integration of psychological insights and Bismarck's political strategies yields a worthy biography." -- <em>Booklist</em> <br><p></p><br>"Those with a serious interest in the subject will find it an intriguing one-volume addition to existing long works on Bismarck." -- <em>Library Journal</em> <br><p></p><br>"The best biography of the Iron Chancellor to date." -- Simon Sebag Montefiore, <em>Wall Street Journal</em><p></p><br>"Other Bismarck biographies have been written, but what is unique about steinberg's is his effort to give voice to Bismarck's contemories - how they percieved and experienced him."--<em> Christian Century</em><p></p><br>"The book will probably become the standard work in English for some time to come.

Zuehlke (PhD, University of South Dakota) is a counselor in private practice. He has specialties in child, adolescent, and adult psychotherapy and assessment.Values and Worldview Clarification Psychology as a disciplined study did not originate from Christian sources. Moreover, psychology entered the curriculum of Christian education in a significant way only in the last half of the twentieth century, no doubt because the historical and prevalent stance taken by the field of psychology has been that spiritual values have little or no place in counseling&#x2014;a position caused by, among other factors, a competing worldview, political correctness, a liberal church, and an inaccurate understanding of science. In contrast to the historical view, we maintain that the spiritual values reflected in worldviews play an indispensable role in the clinical decisions made by therapists and in the lives of clients who come for treatment. Psychotherapy is not, in fact, devoid of a worldview but embraces either a Christian or an alternative spiritual perspective. Thus, current trends to acknowledge the presence of conflicting worldviews within the professional community reflect a welcome change. For example, the American Psychological Association (APA) mandates that psychologists take an informed view of religion as one of the several significant dimensions of human differences or diversity&#x2014;or else make appropriate referrals. In addition, the American Psychiatric Association&#x2019;s Committee on Religion and Psychiatry recommends that the religiosity of an individual be addressed in clinical practice. Both ethical guidelines require the development of a knowledge base and a competency at all levels of mental health provision: education, training, research, and clinical practice. The truth that religious values have a crucial place in the ethical practice of mental health counseling is beginning to gain official recognition. Fuller Theological Seminary psychology professor Siang-Yang Tan observes, "A biblical approach to counseling... that explicitly utilizes Christian religious values or perspectives and interventions (prayer, use of Scripture) and relies on appropriate spiritual gifts and the power and ministry of the Holy Spirit, makes unique contributions to counseling effectiveness, especially with religious, Christian clients." Big Brother and the Health Care Environment Clearly these are changing times for the mental health profession, which is resulting in a significant amount of confusion. On the one hand, the United States government is starting to limit the establishment of bureaucratic structures around many aspects of its citizens&#x2019; lives and is turning matters of private and family concern over to individual citizens. To compensate for its shrinking involvement, the government is looking to churches and private-sector organizations to provide for the needs of the people in their respective communities. The health care system, on the other hand, is not shrinking but rather expanding its regulatory control. It manages care through cost controls and by "rationing" health care services. Managed care&#x2019;s influence in the mental health field has established bureaucratic structures that regulate practices in counseling. In addition, the actions of state licensing boards, professional practitioner organizations, and the court system serve to maintain a politically correct stranglehold on Christian practitioners. Consequently, the community of Christian mental health consumers and practitioners has been limited in its ability to mutually determine its values and spiritual approaches. Although secular, humanistic, atheistic, agnostic, and Eastern forms of spirituality are accepted because they are regarded as "politically correct," the values and worldview of biblical Christianity on which this culture and its freedoms are based have been increasingly met with hostility. The Role of the Church This turn of events should not surprise us, for Scripture warns of a coming apostasy (see Matthew 24:24, 37&#x2013;38; 1 Timothy 4:1). In simple terms, an apostate is anyone who has the form and function of religion but who lacks the supernatural power of the Holy Spirit and a commitment to absolute truth. Similarly, apostate churches are those that endorse the cultural misbeliefs and practices of our morally backslidden culture. Instead of righteously influencing society, such churches have become its prey, for whenever we abandon the authority of Scripture we lose our moral compass. The apostle Paul encourages us to "preach the Word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke and encourage&#x2014;with great patience and careful instruction. For the time will come when men will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear. They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths" (2 Timothy 4:2&#x2013;4). Sadly, all too many churches today have become at best irrelevant or at worst proclaimers of a false Christianity that fails to address issues such as public and personal morality. Adverse legal decisions have also contributed to ushering the Christian influence out of the public arena. Examples of such decisions include the banning of school prayer, of Christian symbols on public property at Christmas, and of prayer at graduation ceremonies or sports events. Through the political and legal processes in this country, we are being pressured to practice our religion within our four walls, to stay out of politics, and to stop interfering with society. The church, however, must inform the culture by means of a compassionate voice of truth and empower its members to take righteous stands in the marketplace. The church is supposed to be "the pillar and foundation of the truth" (1 Timothy 3:15), but if we fail to proclaim that truth in love, we will cease to be the salt and light of our culture (see Matthew 5:13&#x2013;16). Law, education, and politics will function in a vacuum without Judeo-Christian principles influencing their actions. The church is not the executor of the state, but it should be the conscience of the state; to do so demands that the church remain true to God&#x2019;s Word. For example, it is difficult, if not impossible, for the conscientious Christian counselor to encourage a client to abandon a homosexual lifestyle when the "church" is vigorously debating whether to ordain homosexuals into ministry.</p><h2>Saint Francis of Assisi: Brother of Creation (Contemplations &amp; Living Wisdom)</h2><p><p>When a small village was plagued by a wild wolf, it is told that a humble friar named Francis came and met the predator with nothing but his gentle words&#x2015;and turned the wolf from a menace to a welcome citizen.

Wordsworth rejoiced in the French Revolution and played a central role in the cultural upheaval that we call the Romantic Revolution.<br><br> He and his fellow Romantics changed forever the way we think about childhood, the sense of the self, our connection to the natural environment, and the purpose of poetry. But his was also a revolutionary life in the old sense of the word, insofar as his art was of memory, the return of the past, the circling back to childhood and youth. This beautifully written biography is purposefully fragmentary, momentary, and selective, opening up what Wordsworth called "the hiding-places of my power."</p><p>Sir <b>Jonathan Bate</b> is Foundation Professor of Environmental Humanities at Arizona State University and a senior research fellow at Oxford University, where he was formerly provost of Worcester College.</p><h2>Disney Princess Snow White: Mirror, Mirror (Twisted Tales 384 Disney)</h2><p>What if the Evil Queen poisoned the prince?

And etiquette has never been Kate&#x2019;s forte. <br><br> She cocks her head, trying to discern if the siren is approaching or receding, an instinctual habit&#x2014;a professional obligation&#x2014;of assessing potential levels of danger. Here in Paris, at this hour, sirens are unusual. This city is less noisy than other global capitals, London or New York, Mumbai or Hong Kong. And much less than where Kate lived before here: Luxembourg, perhaps the least noisy capital in the world; and Washington, which doesn&#x2019;t even make the cut of the twenty most populous US cities. <br><br> But Kate has traveled plenty. For her job, dispatching her to far-flung destinations in Latin America and Europe. And for the past few years for adventure, driving around the Continent in their aging station wagon, with their EU driver&#x2019;s licenses and bilingual kids. <br><br> Other metropoli have all seemed like more aggressive aural assaults than Paris, with more insistent car horns honked more frequently, more idling trucks and unmufflered motorcycles, jackhammers and pile drivers and bass-heavy music blaring from souped-up sound systems, fire trucks and ambulances and police cars in hot pursuit, the unmistakable urban sounds of urgency, emergency.<br><br> It&#x2019;s in the mornings when Paris feels especially hushed, and in particular this slice of the <i>septi�me</i>, sleepy caf�s on the quiet corners of narrow streets, well-dressed women depositing well-groomed kids at the towering green door of the school&#x2019;s fortress-like fa�ade, forbidding stone walls from which no sounds can escape, nor for that matter children. <br><br> The siren grows louder, nearer. <br><br> A curbside fence prevents the kids from running into the street, getting hit by cars. Every school&#x2019;s sidewalk is lined with these fences, festooned with locked-up bicycles and kick-scooters decorated with decals of football clubs, pop singers, flower petals. The kids are absolutely safe in there. <br> &nbsp;<br> ***<br> &nbsp;<br> After the <i>Charlie Hebdo</i> massacre, sirens began to take on a new significance, triggering more vital concerns. Then the November attacks ratcheted up the tension further, and then again the Champs-Elys�es shooting, these events produced a permanent propensity to generalized panic. <br><br> Sirens no longer suggest a multicar pile-up on the <i>p�riph�rique</i> or a gangland shoot-out in St-Denis&#x2014;somebody else&#x2019;s problem, somewhere else. These days, sirens could mean a nightclub shooting, hostages in a grocery store, a madman in a museum. Sirens could mean that Kate should storm into school, drag out her children, initiate one of her emergency protocols, go-bags from the linen closet, the always-gassed-up car in the garage, speeding out of the city toward the secret farmhouse in the Ardennes, or the airbase in the Ruhr, or somewhere else, anywhere else.<br><br> These days, sirens could mean anything. <br><br> It&#x2019;s what everyone is talking about, the shopkeepers, restaurateurs, hoteliers. Tourism is down. Locals are wary. Customers scarce. Soldiers and police patrol the streets in threes and fours, heavily armed, flak-jacket clad. Not only near the ministries and embassies, the busy commercial boulevards and the famous monuments, but everywhere, soldiers are loitering even here, on sedate residential streets. <br><br> The military has become a permanent presence, the new normal. Sharpshooters have taken positions in the latticework of the Eiffel Tower, the flying buttresses of Notre-Dame, the neoclassical roof of the Arc de Triomphe. Everyone is getting used to it. <br><br> This is how a police state happens, isn&#x2019;t it? An emergency that never subsides. Everything is getting worse all the time, so the far-right steps in and promises to solve it all&#x2014;the taxes, the unemployment, the poverty and immigration and terrifying violence out in <i>les banlieues</i>, Balkan gunrunners and Albanian drug dealers and Corsican mobsters. <br><br> The police suit up, and never stand down. <br><br> People are talking about getting out of town, buying a crumbling pile of ch�teau in the country, starting a biodynamic vineyard or an ecofriendly bed-and-breakfast. Or to hell with it, leaving France entirely, moving to Zurich, to Helsinki or Lisbon or Edinburgh, places that are immune, or seem to be.<br><br> Kate hears a second siren, coming from another direction. <br><br> The other moms seem to be oblivious to the noise, nattering about nothing. Kate tunes them out, scans the bulletin board next to her, pushpinned with notices for kids&#x2019; activities, community meetings, nannies, holidays, the week&#x2019;s lunch menu&#x2014;symbols for organic, for local, for vegetarian&#x2014;next to the list of every kid&#x2019;s allergies, right out there on the sidewalk for anyone to see. <br> The goodbyes begin. With all this cheek kissing, it takes forever to say hello and goodbye. Like adding a whole new category of daily chore, now every morning you have to iron a shirt, mop the kitchen floor. <br><br> &#x201c;What time would suit tonight?&#x201d; asks Hashtag Mom. &#x201c;And what shall we bring?&#x201d; Hashtag Mom never lived anywhere except New Jersey until she was thirty-one, when she moved with her global-banker husband to London, then Singapore, then Paris. Somewhere along the way, she apparently started pretending to be British. <br><br> &#x201c;Bring nothing,&#x201d; Kate says, &#x201c;except your good company. Everyone&#x2019;s coming at seven.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;Lovely.&#x201d; Hashtag Mom leans in for her final air-kiss. For Hashtag Mom, everything, always, is hashtag lovely. <br><br> As much time as Kate needs to spend kissing all these women, she&#x2019;s increasingly unwelcome to kiss her own children, not in public, especially not the mortified older one. But Kate is confident that her younger boy is just going along with that pose because that&#x2019;s what younger siblings do; she knows that Ben still wants his mother&#x2019;s kisses. So she sneaks them onto his head when Jake isn&#x2019;t looking, an open secret right there in a crowd. <br><br> The sirens are closing in. <br><br> Now other people finally begin to react, to tilt their heads, dart their eyes, searching for whatever proximate threat might be attracting the police. <br><br> Cautionary tales, the things you hear: the aroma that turns out to be a ruptured gas main, the staph infection that over the weekend becomes an amputated leg. Lessons in vigilance, the things you could&#x2019;ve done, should&#x2019;ve done, if only you&#x2019;d been worried enough, if you hadn&#x2019;t been so lazy, so selfish, if you&#x2019;d had the courage to follow your fear from the very first flush. But it&#x2019;s only in hindsight that you see it clearly: this was one of those moments. <br><br> Everyone turns in unison, to where the narrow street ends at a broad boulevard, glimpses through the gap of a convoy zooming past, motorcycles followed by squad cars followed by armored trucks then more motorcycles sweeping up the rear, all those dark-blue vehicles with lights flashing, a thundering herd galloping in the direction of the river, the museums, the presidential palace, it&#x2019;s all just over there, spitting distance.&nbsp;<br><br> Shooting distance. <br><br> It&#x2019;s terror that&#x2019;s amassing in Kate, a sense that something is very wrong. <br><br> Maybe it&#x2019;s finally here: payback for all her mistakes. Her parenting mistakes and filial ones, her professional mistakes, matrimonial, her wrongdoings in every segment of life. She wakes up every single morning prepared for it to happen, for her life to be assailed. <br><br> Maybe it&#x2019;s today.<br><br></p></p><h2>The Argentina Reader: History, Culture, Politics (The Latin America Readers)</h2><p>Excessively European, refreshingly European, not as European as it looks, struggling to overcome a delusion that it is European. Argentina&#x2014;in all its complexity&#x2014;has often been obscured by variations of the "like Europe and not like the rest of Latin America" clich�. <i>The Argentina Reader</i> deliberately breaks from that viewpoint. This essential introduction to Argentina&#x2019;s history, culture, and society provides a richer, more comprehensive look at one of the most paradoxical of Latin American nations: a nation that used to be among the richest in the world, with the largest middle class in Latin America, yet one that entered the twenty-first century with its economy in shambles and its citizenry seething with frustration. <p></p><p>This diverse collection brings together songs, articles, comic strips, scholarly essays, poems, and short stories. Most pieces are by Argentines. More than forty of the texts have never before appeared in English. <i>The Argentina Reader</i> contains photographs from Argentina&#x2019;s National Archives and images of artwork by some of the country&#x2019;s most talented painters and sculptors. Many selections deal with the history of indigenous Argentines, workers, women, blacks, and other groups often ignored in descriptions of the country. At the same time, the book includes excerpts by or about such major political figures as Jos� de San Mart�n and Juan Per�n. Pieces from literary and social figures virtually unknown in the United States appear alongside those by more well-known writers such as Jorge Luis Borges, Ricardo Piglia, and Julio Cort�zar.</p><p>The <i>Argentina</i> <i>Reader</i> covers the Spanish colonial regime; the years of nation building following Argentina&#x2019;s independence from Spain in 1810; and the sweeping progress of economic growth and cultural change that made Argentina, by the turn of the twentieth century, the most modern country in Latin America. The bulk of the collection focuses on the twentieth century: on the popular movements that enabled Peronism and the revolutionary dreams of the 1960s and 1970s; on the dictatorship from 1976 to 1983 and the accompanying culture of terror and resistance; and, finally, on the contradictory and disconcerting tendencies unleashed by the principles of neoliberalism and the new global economy. The book also includes a list of suggestions for further reading.</p><p><i>The Argentina</i> <i>Reader</i> is an invaluable resource for those interested in learning about Argentine history and culture, whether in the classroom or in preparation for travel in Argentina.</p></p><p>"Impossible to find a better introduction to the labyrinth, enigma and delight that is Argentina, from the first sightings to the latest curses.

For the following half-century of extraordinary decline, our main source is Michael Psellus, one of the greatest courtiers and men of letters of the age. <br> &nbsp;<br> His vivid and forceful chronicle, full of psychological insight and deep understanding of power politics, is a historical and literary document of the first importance. Recent scholars have shattered forever the view that the Byzantine Age was just a shabby and disreputable appendage to the Roman Empire; Psellus, a man of striking refinement and humanity, both portrays and exemplifies at its best the Byzantine way of life.</p><p><b>Michael Psellus</b>, Byzantine philosopher, historian, and man of letters, was born in Constantinople in 1018. An infant prodigy, he attracted the notice of important patrons and eventually entered the government service, and, as one short-lived emperor succeeded another, became extremely influential. Falling into disfavor on Constantine IX&#x2019;s death, Psellus for a time became a monk, but finding he had no vocation returned to court to resume a leading role in government, becoming chief minister of the empire under Michael VII Ducas. His literary output was immense, and not all of it has been identified, let alone published, but he is regarded today as one of the greatest courtiers and men of letters of his age.<br><br><b>E. R.

Building upon the work of Sigmund Freud, he sought to refine Freudian insights with the use of linguistics, arguing that &#x201c;the structure of unconscious is like a language&#x201d;. Controversial throughout his lifetime both for adopting mathematical concepts in his psychoanalytic framework and for advocating therapy sessions of varying length, he is widely misunderstood and often unfairly dismissed as impenetrable.<br> <br> In this clear, wide-ranging primer, Lionel Bailly demonstrates how Lacan&#x2019;s ideas are still vitally relevant to contemporary issues of mental health treatment.

He will be Distinguished Visiting Professor at Williams College, Massachusetts, January to May 2008.Herodotus: The Great Invasion and the Historian's TaskAs was to become customary, at the beginning of his work Herodotus tells us why he wrote it. It was, he says, "so that human achievements may not become forgotten in time, and great and marvellous deeds--some displayed by Greeks, some by barbarians--may not be without their glory; and especially to show why the two peoples fought with each other." In other words his history was a monument, a marker set down against the oblivion with which time threatens all human deeds. He was successful beyond all reasonable expectation. We are still reading his account of his great theme, the invasion of Greece two and a half thousand years ago, and a mere half century before he wrote it, by the Persian Great King and the immense polyglot army drawn from all parts of his empire. Herodotus also promises a little later (<i>Histories</i>, I.95) to tell us how the Persians under their ruler Cyrus (the Great) won their predominant position in Asia, and this promise too he fulfils before going on to his account of the invasion of Greece.One point in his initial statement which is worth pausing on is the reference to recording the great deeds of barbarians (i.e. non-Greeks) as well as Greeks. We should look in vain in the Egyptian and Babylonian records for such even-handedness. What we are reminded of is Homer, who, as Herodotus soon reminds us, had written of an earlier conflict between Greeks and an Asiatic people. Homer allows his readers/hearers to sympathize with Trojans as well as Greeks, and as much or more with Priam and Hector as with Achilles and Agamemnon. Herodotus does not comment on this feature in Homer, but seems to take it for granted. He accepts, of course, the historicity of the Trojan War, though he thinks that Homer, as a poet, shaped his narrative to his epic purpose, and he is willing to correct him from his own inquiries among the Persians and Egyptians and by his own common sense: Helen could not have been in Troy during the siege, because the Trojans would have handed her back if they could (II.120). Herodotus has a pretty good idea when Homer lived, placing it some four hundred years before his own time, which is the mid fifth century bc.But far more important than Herodotus' acceptance of the basic historicity of the Homeric poems is their existence, for all Greeks, as a narrative model. When Herodotus in his preamble speaks of writing to preserve great and marvellous deeds from oblivion and giving them their deserved glory, he can hardly be unaware of stretching out a hand to the Homeric epic, which purports to do precisely that. Herodotus' narrative of the great conflict sometimes carries Homeric echoes which we shall have to consider, but more generally the pacing of the narrative, the immediacy of its re-enactments of events and presentation of character, its humanity and its inclusion of the earthy and mundane--more than in Thucydides and historiography subsequent to him--all invite the adjective "Homeric." It is, however, Homeric on a vast scale, and therefore looser and deliberately digressive, as well as based on painstaking inquiries, sometimes requiring suspension of judgement, all of which is alien to the epic tradition. Herodotus is a garrulous, highly personal and conversational writer, with no aversion to the first person; one meets him face to face, as it were, so that it is not difficult to imagine the readings he gave in Athens by which his work was apparently first made public. We know his opinions, and hear of his travels, the wonders he has seen, the stories told to him, and his not infrequent scepticism about them. We can even reconstruct a good deal of his religious views, though here he is sometimes reticent. He is almost as personal a writer as Montaigne.He was born, apparently around the mid-480s bc, in the Greek colony of Halicarnassus on the eastern side of the Aegean, so he belonged to that part of the Greek world transplanted to Asia. As the disputed borderland of Greece and the Persian empire, this area was to play a significant part in his history. Since the territory had recently been incorporated in the Persian empire, Herodotus was born technically a subject of the Great King. Though there is ultimately no doubt where his sympathies lie, and it seems he could speak only Greek, he never speaks of the Persians with contempt and has no difficulty in making his narrative identify with them as required. Though he travelled extensively--the extent has been questioned by some--and later apparently migrated to Athens, where he is said to have been a friend of the tragic dramatist Sophocles, it is surely appropriate that a man of such cosmopolitanism should have been born not only in an area which had seen Greek intellectual life hitherto most vigorously flourishing but at the interface of two great cultures, and pretty much at the centre of the known world. The date of his death is not certain, but it is clear that he lived into the period of the Peloponnesian War, i.e. at least beyond 430 bc. He is therefore, according to the best estimates, a generation earlier than Thucydides, though a contemporary, measured by the dates of their respective births and deaths.Herodotus lists some early instances of friction between Europe and Asia--mythic or legendary--including the voyage of Jason and his Argonauts to Colchis, on the Black Sea, and the theft of the Golden Fleece. Then he rapidly advances to historical times, with the Persian conquest of the Hellenized kingdom of Lydia, in what is now western Turkey, under its king Croesus. Croesus, who plays a large part in Book I (the division into nine books is not original), is the first historical character to appear. Overthrown as a ruler, so that his career vindicates the wise saying of the Athenian Solon that no man can be called happy till he is dead, Croesus, made wise by his reversal of fortune, becomes the counsellor of his conqueror, the Persian king Cyrus. We are also told of the legendary youth of Cyrus, who was saved by a shepherd from exposure as a baby (I.108-17), and of the supplanting of the ruling Medes by the Persians under him. Cyrus then goes on to overthrow Babylon (539 bc), of whose customs Herodotus provides a description (I.192-200), after giving the reader a kind of conducted tour of the city.The great wall I have described is the chief armour of the city; but there is a second one within it, hardly less strong though narrower. There is a fortress in the middle of each half of the city [i.e. as divided by the river]: in one the royal palace surrounded by a wall of great strength, in the other the temple of Bel, the Babylonian Zeus. The temple is a square building, two furlongs each way, with bronze gates, and was still in existence in my time; it has a solid central tower, one furlong square, with a second erected on top of it and then a third, and so on up to eight. All eight towers can be climbed by a spiral way running round the outside, and about half-way up there are seats and a shelter for those who make the ascent to rest on. On the summit of the topmost tower stands a great temple with a fine large couch in it, richly covered, and a golden table beside it. The shrine contains no image and no one spends the night there except, as the Chaldaeans who are the priests of Bel say, one Assyrian woman, all alone, whoever it may be that the god has chosen. The Chaldaeans also say--though I do not believe them--that the god enters the temple in person and takes his rest upon the bed. There is a similar story told by the Egyptians at Thebes . . . (I.178-86)When Herodotus visited Babylon it was approximately a century since the city had fallen to Cyrus.Herodotus' next three books deal with the further expansion of the Persian empire into Asia under Cyrus' son Cambyses and his successor Darius. It is Darius who makes the first incursion into Europe, his army being turned back by the Athenian victory at Marathon (490 bc) (VI.110-17). But overall the advance of the Persian empire seems unstoppable as, after swallowing the Greek colonies and the Hellenized kingdoms of western Asia, it advances to the limits of the known world. It comes to include not only the ancient civilizations of Egypt and Mesopotamia but the barely explored territories of Libya and Ethiopia and the nomads of the Arabian desert and the northern steppes. The effect is similar to that achieved by Edward Gibbon more than two thousand years later in his <i>Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</i>, as he successively introduces the peoples who will overwhelm the Roman world.Herodotus, in Books II to IV, follows the tide of Persian conquest by giving geographical and ethnographic surveys of the conquered lands and peoples. These surveys make up a substantial part of his work, and we shall need to return to them later. As a preamble to the great invasion of Greece under the Persian king Xerxes, the Persian world domination, as it seems, is made visible in the great muster of the composite army that Xerxes assembles, which Herodotus describes in detail, identifying each people in the review, with its distinctive appearance, clothing and weapons, beginning with the Persians themselves. The descriptions, and that of the accompanying fleet (VII.61-100), are too long for anything but a representative excerpt:The Assyrians were equipped with bronze helmets made in a complicated barbarian way which is hard to describe, shields, spears, daggers (like the Egyptian ones), wooden clubs studded with iron, and linen corslets . . . The Indians were dressed in cotton; they carried cane bows and cane arrows tipped with iron, and marched under the command of Pharnazathres, the son of Artabates . . . Then there were the Caspians and the Sarangians, the former commanded by Ariomardus, the brother of Artyphius, dressed in leather jackets and armed with the <i>acinaces</i> [Persian short sword] and the cane bow of their country . . .And so it goes on, with the Arabians, the Ethiopians ("in their leopard skins and lion skins"), the Libyans, the Phrygians, the Thracians in fox-skin headdresses--the list is apparently endless. It seems as though the whole known world is gathering, hundreds of thousands strong (the numbers have predictably been much debated), to crush the small city states of Greece--from the Nile and the Libyan desert, from the rivers of what was later to be European Russia, and from Thrace west of the Black Sea to India and beyond, as well as from Persia itself. A local man, seeing the Persian host, cries out in his anguish that Zeus has changed his name to Xerxes (VII.56).Herodotus is in no doubt that Athens was the core of Greek resistance and suffered most, being directly in the path of the invaders. The most crucial policy decision on the Greek side was that of the Athenians not to defend the city but to retreat across the isthmus to the Peloponnese and rely on their fleet to defeat the Persians. The determining factor, in Herodotus' account, was Themistocles' interpretation of the Delphic oracle, whose prophetess had declared, enigmatically as usual, that "the wooden wall only shall not fall." Some thought this referred to a thorn hedge which surrounded the Acropolis, but Themistocles spoke out for those who interpreted the wooden wall as a reference to the Athenian ships, and was believed. Athens took the lead in the great sea battle of Salamis (480 bc), in which the Persians lost their fleet and which was a severe check for them (VIII.78-96).But the most memorable episode of the invasion, given full treatment by Herodotus, was a defeat for Greece: the sacrificial battle fought earlier the same year by the three hundred Spartans under their king Leonidas at the pass of Thermopylae, in which most were killed (VII.210-28). Spartans were forbidden by law to retreat. The column subsequently erected to their memory bore what is, in its terse simplicity, still probably, even in translation, the most moving of all military memorial inscriptions:GO TELL THE SPARTANS, STRANGER,THAT HERE OBEDIENT TO THEIR LAWS WE LIE.Herodotus says that he has taken the trouble to learn the names of all three hundred "who deserve to be remembered." It is characteristic that he mentions some of the Persian dead by name, and their ancestry. It is from Herodotus too, though it may not originate with him, that we have, put into the mouth of Croesus, one of the most famous epigrams on war: that in peace sons bury their fathers, but in war fathers bury their sons.Herodotus' portrait of Xerxes, who deals atrociously with Leonidas' corpse, contains odd contradictions, perhaps reflecting different traditions. In some moods Xerxes shows good sense and magnanimity, in others a wilful savagery. He commits a sin of hubris, Herodotus strongly implies, when he causes the Hellespont to be whipped as the punishment for destroying, in a storm, the bridges he had had built:Xerxes was very angry when he heard of the disaster, and gave orders that the Hellespont should receive three hundred lashes and have a pair of fetters thrown into it. I have heard before now that he also sent people to brand it with hot irons. He certainly instructed the men with the whips to utter, as they wielded them, the barbarous and presumptuous words: "You salt and bitter stream, your master lays this punishment upon you for injuring him, who never injured you. But Xerxes the King will cross you, with or without your permission . . ." In addition to punishing the Hellespont Xerxes gave orders that the men responsible for building the bridges should have their heads cut off. (VII.35)Herodotus then goes on to give a technical description of how the bridges were rebuilt.Xerxes' most atrocious act occurs when a servant to whom he owed much pleaded that the eldest of his five sons should be left at home: Xerxes has the son cut in half for the army to march between the two halves on its route. Yet immediately afterwards we have the episode in which he appears most sympathetic and human, when sitting on a throne of white marble he is able to view his whole army and fleet and suddenly, at the moment of his highest glory, he weeps. "And when he saw the whole Hellespont hidden by ships, and all the beaches and plains of Abydos filled with men, he called himself happy--and the moment after burst into tears." Asked why, he replies that he was thinking of the shortness of human life, and that "of all these thousands of men not one will be alive in a hundred years' time" (VII.45-6).</p><h2>Martin Dressler: The Tale of an American Dreamer</h2><p>Winner of the Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award Finalist<br><br>Young Martin Dressler begins his career as an industrious helper in his father's cigar store.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of his restless young manhood, he makes a swift and eventful rise to the top, accompanied&nbsp;&nbsp;by two sisters--one a dreamlike shadow, the other a worldly business partner.

"I had often before this said," she later wrote, "that if the Indians should come, I should chuse rather to be killed by them than taken alive but when it came to the tryal my mind changed; their glittering weapons so daunted my spirit, that I chose rather to go along . . . than to end my days."<br>Thus began Mary Rowlandson's account of her arduous journey as a servant to her captors, the Narragansett Indians. The most celebrated such document in American history, her record of the three months she spent in captivity tells of hardship and suffering, but also includes invaluable observations on Native American life and customs. The text is notable, as well, for conveying an understanding of her captors as individuals who not only suffered and faced difficult decisions but were also, at times, sympathetic humans (one of her abductors gave her a Bible taken during an earlier raid).<br>An immediate bestseller when first published in 1682, Rowlandson's narrative is widely regarded today as a classic--the first in a series of "captivity narratives" in which women, seized by Indians, survived against overwhelming odds. Of special interest to historians and students of Native American culture, Rowlandson's astounding account &#x2014; accompanied by three other famous narratives of captivity &#x2014; will also thrill the most avid of adventure enthusiasts.</p><p></p><h2>Why Kill the Innocent (Sebastian St. Cyr Mystery)</h2><p><b>A brutal murder draws nobleman Sebastian St. Cyr into the tangled web of the British royal court in this gripping historical mystery from the national bestselling author of <i>Where the Dead Lie</i>.</b><br><br><i>London, 1814.</i> As a cruel winter holds the city in its icy grip, the bloody body of a beautiful young musician is found half-buried in a snowdrift.

She kept her head bowed, her fists clenched in the fine cloth of her merino carriage gown as she struggled to drag its sodden weight through the knee-deep drifts clogging the ancient winding lane. A footman with a lantern staggered ahead of her to light the darkness, for Clerkenwell was a wretched, dangerous area on the outskirts of the City, and night had fallen long ago.<br><br> She was here, alone except for the footman and a petite French midwife who floundered through the snow in her wake, because of an article she was writing on the hardships faced by the families of men snatched off the streets by the Royal Navy's infamous press gangs. The midwife, Alexi Sauvage, had offered to introduce Hero to the desperate eight-months-pregnant wife of a recently impressed cooper. No one had expected the woman to go into labor just as a fierce snowstorm swept in to render the narrow lanes of the district impassable to a gentlewoman's carriage. Thanks to their presence, mother and child both survived the long, hard birth. But the snow just kept getting deeper.<br><br> "Do you see it yet?" Alexi called, peering through the whirl of white toward where Hero's carriage awaited them at the base of Shepherds' Lane.<br><br> Hero brought up a cold-numbed hand to shield her eyes. "It should be j-"<br><br> She broke off as her foot caught on something half-buried in the snow and she pitched forward to land in a deep drift on quickly outflung hands. She started to push up again, then froze as she realized she was staring at the tousled dark hair of a body that lay facedown beside her.<br><br> The footman swung about in alarm, the light from his lantern swaying wildly. "My lady!"<br><br> "Mon Dieu," whispered Alexi, coming to crouch next to her. "It's a woman. Help me turn her, quickly."<br><br> Together they heaved the stiffening woman onto her back. The winter had been so wretchedly cold, with endless weeks of freezing temperatures and soaring food and coal prices, that more and more of the city's poor were being found dead in the streets. But this was no ragged pauper woman. Her fine black pelisse was lined with fur, and the dusky curls framing her pale face were fashionably cut. Hero stared into those open sightless eyes and had no need to see the bloody gash on the side of the woman's head to know that she was dead.<br><br> "She must have slipped and hit something," said Hero.<br><br> "I don't think so." Alexi Sauvage studied the ugly wound with professional interest. As a female, she could be licensed in England to practice only as a midwife. But Alexi had trained as a physician in Italy, where such things were allowed. "She couldn't have died here. A wound like this bleeds profusely-look at all the blood in her hair and on her pelisse. Yet there's hardly any blood in the snow around her." With tender hands, she brushed away the rapidly falling flakes that half obscured the dead woman's face. "I wonder who she is."<br><br> Hero watched the snow fall away from those still features and felt her chest give an odd lurch. "I know her. She's a musician named Jane Ambrose. She teaches piano to"-she paused as Alexi swung her head to stare at her-"to Princess Charlotte. The Regent's daughter."<br><br> Chapter 2<br><br> S ebastian St. Cyr, Viscount Devlin, stood at the river steps below Westminster Bridge, his worried gaze on the turgid ice-filled expanse of the Thames before him.<br><br> Never in anyone's memory had London seen a winter such as this. Beginning in December and lasting for more than a week, a great killing fog had smothered the city with a darkness so heavy it could be felt. After that came days of endless snow that buried the entire Kingdom beneath vast drifts said in some places to run as much as twenty-three feet deep. And then, yesterday, a brief, sudden thaw sent massive blocks of ice from up the Thames spinning downriver to be carried back and forth by the tide, catching in eddies and against the arches of the bridges, where they crashed into one another with a series of echoing booms that reminded Sebastian of artillery fire. Now, with this evening's plunging temperatures and new snowfall, the city had turned into a strange black-and-white world of bleak windblown drifts cut by a ribbon of darkly dangerous ice-filled waters. And still the snow fell thick and fast around him.<br><br> He was aware of a strange silence that seemed to press down on the city, unnatural enough to be troubling. Twenty years of war combined with falling wages, soaring prices, and widespread starvation had already brought England to her knees. There was a very real worry that this vicious, killing winter might be more than the country could-or would-bear.<br><br> He glanced back at the ancient stone walls of the Houses of Parliament, which rose just beyond the bridge. They seemed so strong and invincibly enduring. Yet he knew they were not.<br><br> "Gov'nor." A familiar shrill cockney voice cut through the icy silence. "Gov'nor!"<br><br> Sebastian turned to see his sharp-faced young groom, or tiger, slip and almost fall as he took the icy footpath curling down from the bridge. "Tom? What the devil are you doing here?"<br><br> "I like t' never found ye, yer honor," said Tom, almost falling again as he skidded to a halt. "A message jist come to Brook Street from 'er ladyship."<br><br> "Yes, I heard she's been delayed in Clerkenwell."<br><br> "Aye, but this is a second message, yer honor. She's at the Queen's 'Ead near the Green, and she says you'll be wantin' t' come right away. Somebody close to Princess Charlotte's been murdered, and 'er ladyship done tripped over the body jist alyin' there in the street!"<br><br> o<br><br> He found Hero beside a roaring fire in the private parlor of a ramshackle old inn at the base of Shepherds� Lane. She stood lost in thought, her hands held out to the blaze. Her wet, rich dark hair lay plastered against her face; the skirts of the elegant black gown she wore in mourning for her dead mother hung limp and sodden.<br><br> "Devlin. Thank heavens," she said, turning as he entered.<br><br> "I'm sorry it took so long for your message to find me." She was one of the strongest people he knew, determinedly rational and fiercely brave. But as she came into his arms and he held her close, he felt a faint shudder rack her tall Junoesque frame. "Are you all right?"<br><br> "Yes." She drew back to give him a lopsided smile, as if vaguely embarrassed by that brief display of vulnerability. "Although more shaken than I'd care to admit."<br><br> "Anyone would be shaken."<br><br> "Not Alexi. She's gone off to treat the cook's frostbite."<br><br> Sebastian grunted. He wasn't sure anything could shock that enigmatic fiery-haired Frenchwoman. But all he said was "Tell me what happened."<br><br> He drew her back to the fire's warmth while she provided him with a crisp, calm summary. "A couple of the parish constables are guarding the body," she said. "But I made certain they sent word directly to Sir Henry at Bow Street rather than to the public office here at Hatton Garden."<br><br> "That was wise," said Sebastian. Violent deaths connected in any way with the royal family had a tendency to present the officials involved with a Faustian dilemma. And the magistrates of Hatton Garden had in the past proven themselves to be far from reliable. "Does anyone else know yet?"<br><br> "Not to my knowledge."<br><br> Sebastian nodded, his gaze meeting hers. There was no need to give voice to what both were thinking. "Good."<br><br> o<br><br> Sir Henry Lovejoy arrived in Clerkenwell not long after Sebastian.<br><br> The Bow Street magistrate was a small man, barely five feet tall, with stern religious views, a serious demeanor, and unshakable integrity. There'd been a time not so long ago when Sebastian had been a fugitive on the run for murder and Sir Henry the magistrate tasked with tracking him down. But in the years since then an unusual friendship had developed between the Earl's son and the dour middle-aged magistrate. As different as the two men were, they shared a fierce dedication to the pursuit of justice.<br><br> Huddled now in a heavy greatcoat with a scarf covering his lower face, Sir Henry stood outside the Queen's Head in quiet consultation with his constables while Sebastian handed Hero up into her carriage. Sebastian was watching the coachman pull away to carefully guide his team down the snowy street when Sir Henry came up beside him.<br><br> "Her ladyship is certain of the victim's identity?" said the magistrate, his eyes narrowing as the carriage's rear wheels slid sideways on the icy cobbles.<br><br> Sebastian nodded. "I'm afraid so."<br><br> "Not a good situation."<br><br> "No," agreed Sebastian.<br><br> The carriage swung around a distant corner, and the two men turned to wade through the deep drifts clogging Shepherds' Lane. The snow still fell thick and fast around them.<br><br> Two parish constables stood guard over a dark, silent form rapidly disappearing beneath the falling snow. The men had been stomping their feet and swinging their arms in an effort to stay warm, but at the Bow Street magistrate's approach, both went rigid.<br><br> "At ease, men," said Sir Henry.<br><br> "Aye, yer honor," said one of the constables, although he still didn't move.<br><br> Crouching down beside Jane Ambrose's body, Sebastian yanked off his glove and used his bare hand to brush gently at the snow that had already re-covered the dead woman's lifeless skin and dark blue lips. She'd been a poignantly attractive woman, he thought, his hand curling into a fist as he rested his forearm on his bent knee; she was probably somewhere in her early thirties, with thick dark hair, wide cheekbones, and a heart-shaped face.<br><br> The side of her head was a pulpy mess.<br><br> Lovejoy thrust his hands deep into the pockets of his greatcoat and looked away. "Did you know her, as well?"<br><br> Sebastian pulled on his glove again, his gaze returning to that still, pale face. "Only by reputation." She'd been born Jane Somerset, the daughter of the organist at Westminster Abbey. As child prodigies, she and her twin, James, had given numerous musical performances to great acclaim. But modesty required females of her class to retire from public view once they reached marriageable age. And so, while her brother James Somerset had gone on to be acknowledged as a promising young composer and one of the greatest pianists of their age, Jane had ceased to perform, married a successful dramatist named Edward Ambrose, and confined herself to such socially acceptable "feminine" pursuits as writing glees and ballads and teaching piano to the children of the wealthy. Premier amongst those students was Princess Charlotte, ebullient young daughter of the Regent and heiress presumptive to the throne behind her father.<br><br> Sebastian found himself considering Jane Ambrose's ties to the House of Hanover as he studied the pink-tinged snow around the dead woman's head. Alexi Sauvage was right: If Jane Ambrose had been killed here in Shepherds' Lane, the snow would have been drenched crimson with her blood. It was not.<br><br> "I wonder why she was left here, of all places," he said aloud.<br><br> Lovejoy hunched his shoulders against an icy gust. "Unfortunately, the wind and snow have covered any tracks her killer might have left. I suppose it's possible she was attacked somewhere near here by footpads who were then interrupted in the process of dragging the body to a less public locale."<br><br> Sebastian touched the bloodstained fur-trimmed collar of Jane Ambrose's pelisse where a gold locket still hung around the dead woman's neck. "No footpad would leave that."<br><br> Lovejoy cast a quick glance around, then crouched on the far side of the body and pitched his voice low enough to be inaudible to the constables holding back the crowds that were beginning to gather despite the freezing temperature and wind-driven snow. "And yet I fear the palace is likely to insist on saying some such thing is what happened. If we're to get a postmortem, we'd best move quickly."<br><br> Sebastian met the magistrate's gaze and nodded.<br><br> Pushing to his feet, Lovejoy sent one of his men running to the nearest deadhouse for a shell that could be used to transport the body to the surgery of Paul Gibson, an anatomist known for his ability to read the evidence left by violent death. It was when they were lifting what was left of Jane Ambrose onto the shell that Sebastian noticed the dead woman's hands, which until then had lain hidden beneath the folds of her pelisse.<br><br> They were bare.<br><br> "She's not wearing gloves," said Sebastian. "Or a hat, for that matter."<br><br> Lovejoy came to stand beside him. "How very odd." Even in the best of weather, no gentlewoman would think of appearing in public without a hat and gloves. And in this weather, it would be madness. "I'll set the lads to beating the snowdrifts to look for them. Perhaps they're lying somewhere hereabouts."<br><br> "Perhaps," said Sebastian. "But it would still be odd."<br><br> Chapter 3<br><br> W hile a solemn-faced Lovejoy set off to personally notify Edward Ambrose of his wife's death, Sebastian spent the better part of the next hour scouting the surrounding area and knocking on the doors of the ancient dilapidated houses that lined the crooked lane. He was hoping to find someone who'd seen or at least heard something. But the bitter cold and heavy snowfall had long ago driven the area's residents to their firesides; no one would admit to knowing anything.<br><br> Giving up, he stood for a moment and watched Lovejoy's constables, their lanterns shuttered against the driving snow as they continued to flounder about in the deep drifts looking for Jane Ambrose's missing hat and gloves or anything else that might help explain what had happened to her. The snow muffled their movements the same way it silenced the usual racket of the vast, freezing city around them. And it struck Sebastian that, so intense was the unnatural hush, they might have been in a snowy forest glen surrounded only by the unseen creatures of the night.<br><br> Readjusting his hat against the snow, he shook off the peculiar thought and turned his steps toward the Tower Hill surgery of a certain one-legged, opium-eating Irishman.<br><br> o<br><br> Sebastian�s friendship with the Irish surgeon Paul Gibson stretched back nearly ten years, to a time when both men wore the King�s colors and fought the King�s wars from Italy and the West Indies to the mountains of Portugal. Then a French cannonball shattered Gibson�s lower left leg, leaving him racked with phantom pains and struggling with a dangerous opium addiction. That was when he had come here, to London, to teach anatomy at hospitals such as St. Thomas�s and St. Bartholomew�s and to open a small surgery in the shadow of the Tower.</p><h2>Plant Life in Field and Garden (Yesterday&#39;s Classics) (Eyes and No Eyes Series)</h2><p>Third volume in the &#34;Eyes and No Eyes&#34; series, introduces children to the wonders of plant life through examination of a variety of plants, including the cabbage, the turnip, the cucumber, and the rose. In addition to becoming familiar with the structure of plants, the reader discovers how seeds grow, how insects help, and how plants defend themselves.

Seven color illustrations and numerous black and white drawings complement the text. Suitable for ages 8 and up.</p><p></p><h2>The Complete Stories of Isaac Asimov</h2><p>The second volume in an extraordinary collection published shortly after the author&#39;s death. In these twenty-three stories, Asimov&#39;s vivid awareness of the potential of technology is translated into human dilemmas. The definitive collection of short fiction by Isaac Asimov, supreme master of the science fiction genre continues with Volume Two of the Complete Stories. The Good Doctor was always ahead of his time and his work stands today as the clearest expression of our collective hopes and fears for the future. But the ever-expanding popularity of his stories with young and old readers alike is explained by their wit, zest and human interest. Within this volume are stories often voted among the best science fiction stories of all time. In these stories Asimov&#39;s vivid awareness of the potential of technology is translated into human dilemmas that are more relevant today than ever before.</p><p>Isaac Asimov, world maestro of science fiction, was born in Russia near Smolensk in 1920 and was brought to the United States by his parents three years later. He grew up in Brooklyn where he went to grammar school and at the age of eight he gained his citizen papers. A remarkable memory helped him finish high school before he was sixteen. He then went on to Columbia University and resolved to become a chemist rather than follow the medical career his father had in mind for him. He graduated in chemistry and after a short spell in the Army he gained his doctorate in 1949 and qualified as an instructor in biochemistry at Boston University School of Medicine where he became Associate Professor in 1955, doing research in nucleic acid. Increasingly, however, the pressures of chemical research conflicted with his aspirations in the literary field, and in 1958 he retired to full-time authorship while retaining his connection with the University. Asimov&#39;s fantastic career as a science fiction writer began in 1939 with the appearance of a short story, `Marooned Off Vesta&#39;, in Amazing Stories. Thereafter he became a regular contributor to the leading SF magazines of the day including Astounding, Astonishing Stories, Super Science Stories and Galaxy. He won the Hugo Award four times and the Nebula Award once. With nearly five hundred books to his credit and several hundred articles, Asimov&#39;s output was prolific by any standards. Apart from his many world-famous science fiction works, Asimov also wrote highly successful detective mystery stories, a four-volume History of North America, a two-volume Guide to the Bible, a biographical dictionary, encyclopaedias, textbooks and an impressive list of books on many aspects of science, as well as two volumes of autobiography. Isaac Asimov died in 1992 at the age of 72.`Isaac Asimov was one of the great explainers of the age...It will never be known how many practicing scientists today, in how many countries, owe their initial inspiration to a book, article, or short story by Isaac Asimov&#39; Carl Sagan `Asimov displayed one of the most dynamic imaginations in science fiction&#39; Daily Telegraph `Asimov&#39;s career was one of the most formidable in science fiction&#39; The Times</p><h2>World Religions and Cults: Counterfeits of Christianity (Volume 1)</h2><p><p><i>This eye-opening first volume presents a clear and thorough analysis of counterfeit religions like Mormonism, Islam, Deism, Jehovah's Witnesses, Zoroastrianism, and many more.</i></p> <p> Religions in today's culture seem to be multiplying. Have you ever wondered why certain religions believe and practice what they do? Or how they view the Bible? This volume delves into these and other engaging questions, such as:</p> <ul> <li>How can a Christian witness to people in these religions?</li> <li>Do these other religions believe in creation and a Creator?</li> <li>How do we deal with these religions from a biblical authority perspective?</li> </ul> <p> Many religions and cults discussed in this first volume openly affirm that the Bible is true, but then something gets in their way. And there is a common factor every time - man's fallible opinions. In one way or another the Bible gets demoted, reinterpreted, or completely ignored. Man's ideas are used to throw the Bible's clear teaching out the window while false teachings are promoted.</p> <p> This book is a must for laymen, church leaders, teachers, and students to understand the trends in our culture and around the world where certain religions dominate, helping you discern truth and guard your faith. When you understand a religion's origins and teachings, you are in a better position to know how to proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ as you take the good news to those in false religions.</p></p><p>Mr. Bodie Hodge attended Southern Illinois University at Carbondale and received a B.S. and M.S. in mechanical engineering.

At a certain distance yet still with access to many of the people who enabled and who opposed the f�hrer and his Third Reich, Toland strove to treat this life as if Hitler lived and died a hundred years before instead of within his own memory. From childhood and obscurity to his desperate end, Adolf Hitler emerges as, in Toland&#x2019;s words, &#x201c;far more complex and contradictory . . . obsessed by his dream of cleansing Europe Jews . . . a hybrid of Prometheus and Lucifer.&#x201d;</p></p><p>A national bestseller with more than 370,000 copies in print, this is "the first book that anyone who wants to learn about Hitler or the war in Europe must read... a marvel of fact."--<i>Newsweek</i><p>John Toland, the author of fifteen works of history and fiction, including<i> Infamy: World War II and Its Aftermath</i>, received the Pulitzer Prize for his magisterial <i>Rising Sun: The Decline of the Japanese Empire, 1936&#x2013;1945</i>.

These stories confirm James Salter as one of the finest writers of our time.</p><p>This short-story collection won the 1989 PEN/Faulkner Award for James Salter, author of Solo Faces and A Sport and A Pastime. Here, Salter&#39;s themes are memory and loss, the demands of honor and the inherent betrayals of sexual relations. Salter works like a miniaturist, evoking vast landscapes in a few lines: &#34;Nothing is safe except for an hour,&#34; he writes in one beautiful story, opening up a whole world-view. Often, at the end of a story that runs only a few pages, the perspective suddenly broadens, the prose elevates to an abstract lyricism, and the reader is transported.<b>&nbsp;James Salter</b> is the author of the novels<i> Light Years, A Sport and a Pastime, Solo Faces, The Arm of Flesh</i> (revised as <i>Cassada</i>), and <i>The Hunters,</i> the memoirs <i>Gods of Tin </i>and <i>Burning the Days</i>, and the collection<i> Last Night.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Philip Gourevitch</b>&#x2019;s books have received numerous honors, including the National Book Critics Circle Award.

It examines the impact of the revolution on society as a whole--on different classes, ethnic groups, the army, men and women, youth. Its central concern is to understand how one structure of domination was replaced by another. The book registers the primacy of politics, but situates political developments firmly in the context of massive economic, social, and cultural change. Since the fall of Communism there has been much reflection on the significance of the Russian Revolution. The book rejects the currently influential, liberal interpretation of the revolution in favor of one that sees it as rooted in the contradictions of a backward society which sought modernization and enlightenment and ended in political tyranny.<br></p><p><br><strong>Stephen Smith</strong> is Professor of History at the University of Essex.

To me a great &#x201c;fall wine" could be a full-bodied white &#x2013; think Chardonnay right off the bat - or a medium-bodied red &#x2013; think Pinot Noir. These, of course, are familiar, even &#x201c;safe choices&#x201d; for the season.<p></p> <p><strong> What are your favorite wines for the fall season, and why? </strong><br> Wines that come to mind are dry whites from Alsace, France &#x2013; especially Gew�rztraminer and Pinot Gris &#x2013; because they are substantial wines with lots of floral and spice notes, which reminds me of falling leaves on a windy day. I also love dry Sherry &#x2013; especially Fino or Manzanilla &#x2013; in the fall, as it is a wonderful, if under-appreciated, wine with cheeses, soups, fish and seafood, and a terrific match with dishes such as eggplant with garlic sauce, mu shu pork, and other Chinese take-out favorites.</p> <p>There are so many red wines that provide a warm glow on a chilly evening, and some of my favorites include:</p> <p>� From the United States: Perhaps my #1 choice for an awesome autumn wine is Zinfandel from California, especially from the Dry Creek Valley in Sonoma County. Good Zin is hearty, but with loads of black fruit and spices on the palate. Seek out those wines with less than 14% alcohol, and save the big-alcohol Zins for the winter months. I also like Pinot Noir from the Willamette Valley of Oregon and the Central Coast appellations of California; wines of balance and finesse.</p> <p>� From Italy: Dolcetto and Barbera from Piedmont; Chianti and Morellino di Scansano from Tuscany; Valpolicella Ripasso from Veneto; Cannonau from Sardinia.</p> <p>� From Spain: Rioja , especially the lighter Crianza bottlings, as well as wines from Bierzo (made from the Mencia grape), and Navarra (which, like Rioja, focuses on the Tempranillo grape). These wines are tremendously food-friendly with white meats, lighter red meats, and cheeses.</p> <p>� From France: Fall is a great time for Beaujolais-Villages, or the under-appreciated Cru Beaujolais (such as Moulin-�-Vent or Brouilly). These wines are great with grilled fish as well as white meats and lean red meats, and will certainly enhance the flavors of seasonal root vegetables. Of course, the Pinot Noir wines of Burgundy are great during this time, but focus on the more accessible, simpler, less expensive wines (Bourgogne, C�te de Beaune-Villages, Mercurey, for example), which are excellent matches for a wide range of foods, from roasted vegetables to beef. Also, try the red wines of the Loire Valley that fly under the radar &#x2013; Chinon, Bourgueil, or Saumur-Champigny; all of them made from the Cabernet Franc grape, and all of them will work beautifully with roasted white meats.</p> <p><strong>What new trends are you seeing in wines this year?</strong><br> A welcome trend is balanced wines with lower alcohol levels, which in a time of climate change/global warming and the resulting super-ripe fruit is a tough trick to pull off. It is important to achieve balance in the wine if it is to play its part at the table as an accompaniment to food, not as a tool to make you drunk.</p> <p>Another trend that I like is less emphasis on oak to carry the aromatics and flavor profile of the wine, especially white wines, and specifically Chardonnay. We see a lot more unoaked Chardonnay, or when oak is used, the winemakers seem to be exhibiting a lighter touch.</p> <p>Perhaps the most welcomed trend I&#x2019;ve observed has to do with the price point of wines. Although hard economic times has led to too much suffering by far too many people, when it comes to wine pricing, we are seeing a &#x201c;new normal.&#x201d; That is, good wines are more affordable than ever before, and wine drinkers are discovering that they don&#x2019;t have to spend a lot of money to enjoy wine. This is a trend that even after our nation returns to good economic health &#x2013; whenever that is &#x2013; will, I believe, remain in place. The United States is already the largest consumer of wine in the world (based on dollars spent), and reasonably priced wine as a daily beverage with meals, or even as an &#x201c;affordable luxury,&#x201d; will only enhance that standing.</p> <p><strong> Any recommendations for dishes to pair with this fall&#x2019;s top wines?</strong><br> In the fall, thoughts turn to Thanksgiving, and the traditional holiday feast is a blessing for both white and red wines. I love Gew�rztraminer with turkey and all the accompaniments &#x2013; sweet potatoes, stuffing (that&#x2019;s &#x201c;dressing&#x201d; down South), cranberries, etc. Chardonnay will work well, too, but with less of a wow factor. For reds, I love Zinfandel, especially if there&#x2019;s sausage and sage in the stuffing/dressing, and plenty of dark meat from the turkey. For subtlety and balance, go with Pinot Noir or Gamay (the grape of Beaujolais).</p> <p><strong> What can people learn about other seasonal wines and trends in <em>Exploring Wine</em>?</strong><br> The completely revised new edition of <em>Exploring Wine</em> goes into great depth about current trends in the international wine market, from California to China, from Italy to India, from Germany to Greece, from Canada to Cyprus. We consider the wines of all of these countries, and many more (France, Spain, Portugal, etc), complete with beautiful maps indicating the wine regions of each nation.</p> <p>In <em>Exploring Wine</em>&#x2019;s chapter on wine and food pairing, we emphasize the &#x201c;how&#x201d; and &#x201c;why&#x201d; of matching food and wine, and that, of course, includes notes on enjoying foods and wines &#x201c;in season.&#x201d; While wine may not technically be a &#x201c;seasonal&#x201d; beverage, clearly our enjoyment is enhanced when we think of it that way; lighter wine with lighter foods in warm weather, more complex and full-bodied wines to accompany heartier foods when the weather gets colder and the snow begins to fall.</p> <p><strong>Tips from <em>Exploring Wine</em></strong> <br> </p><table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <br> <strong>Understanding Wine Color</strong> </td> <td> <br> <strong>Understanding Wine Barrels</strong> </td> <td> <br> <strong>Understanding Food and Wine Pairings</strong> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p></p>In Exploring Wine, three renowned wine experts take you on a glorious tour of the wines of the world.

Gilbert</p><h2>Death of the Liberal Class</h2><p>For decades the liberal class was a defense against the worst excesses of power. But the pillars of the liberal class&#x2014; the press, universities, the labor movement, the Democratic Party, and liberal religious institutions&#x2014;have collapsed. In its absence, the poor, the working class, and even the middle class no longer have a champion.<p> In this searing polemic Chris Hedges indicts liberal institutions, including his former employer, the <i>New York Times</i>, who have distorted their basic beliefs in order to support unfettered capitalism, the national security state, globalization, and staggering income inequalities. Hedges argues that the death of the liberal class created a profound vacuum at the heart of American political life. And now speculators, war profiteers, and demagogues&#x2014; from militias to the Tea Party&#x2014;are filling the void.</p></p><p><b>Chris Hedges</b> is a Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning journalist.

A large American flag is strapped to the side of his green backpack. There is a light drizzle and he is wearing a green Army poncho. Short, muscular, and affable, with his brown hair in a close military crop, Bell tells me when I stop my car that he is on a six-day, ninety-mile, self-styled &#x201c;Liberty Walk&#x201d; from Binghamton to Utica. He plans to mount a quixotic campaign to challenge Democratic incumbent Rep. Michael Arcuri in the 24th Congressional District as the Republican candidate. Bell has camped out along the road for three nights and stayed in cheap motels the other nights. He opposes the health-care bill recently passed by the Democratic-majority Congress, calls for an end to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, advocates the abolishment of the Federal Reserve, is against the Federal Government&#x2019;s Wall Street bailouts, and wants to see immediate government relief for workers, including himself, trapped in prolonged unemployment. He carries a handwritten sign: &#x201c;End the Fed,&#x201d; echoing the title of a book by U.S. Representative Ron Paul he keeps in his backpack, along with a copy of <i>U.S. Constitution for Dummies </i>by Michael Arnheim. He says he plans to deliver Paul&#x2019;s book to Arcuri&#x2019;s office in Utica.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I just walked through the town of Norwich,&#x201d; he says as a car passes and the driver honks in support, &#x201c;and there is a strong Tea Party movement there&#x201d;:<br>&nbsp;<br>The Tea Party movement, for the most part, is just a bunch of disgruntled<br>Americans. They know something is wrong and they are<br>ready to be engaged. A lot of the people in my area who are in the Tea<br>Party are Democrats. People are confused. They are shell-shocked.<br>They don&#x2019;t know what to think. But acting like these problems started<br>January 20 [the date of the presidential inauguration] is absurd. To<br>single out the current president and not the presidents before him is<br>not productive for trying to figure out what is going on.2<br>&nbsp;<br>Bell, who lives in Lansing, New York, is the new face of resistance. He is young, at home in the culture of the military, deeply suspicious of the Federal Government, dismissive of the liberal class, unable to find work, and angry. He swings between right-wing and left-wing populism, expressing admiration for both Paul and U.S. Representative Dennis Kucinich, as well as the Tea Party movement. He started out as a supporter of John McCain in the last presidential election but soured on the Arizona senator and the Republican Party&#x2019;s ties to Wall Street. He ended up not voting in that election. He has raised about $1,000 from neighbors and friends for his own campaign. Adept at martial arts, he made it to the semifinals of the 2010 Army National Guard Combative Championship at Fort Benning in Georgia, where, in his last bout, he suffered a broken nose, bruised his opponent&#x2019;s ribs and thighs, and lost in a split decision.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I am truly terrified when I think about our future,&#x201d; he says:<br>&nbsp;<br>I believe all signs point to a real systemic economic collapse in the<br>near future, maybe even before the midterm elections. I believe this is<br>why many incumbents are stepping down. They seem to know what<br>is coming and of course the rats are jumping ship and taking their<br>pensions with them. There will be nothing the government or the Fed<br>can do to slow the pain, no more tricks in the bag. I assure you it&#x2019;s<br>going to hurt everyone, except of course, the corporate and banking<br>elite. I say let the empire collapse; sometimes we must die to be<br>reborn. The political system as it stands offers little hope for influencing<br>real change or social justice. I propose we attempt to reverse this<br>coup d&#x2019;�tat by attempting a coup of our own. First, we must try to<br>retake the traditional means of control, power and discourse by<br>restoring integrity to our sold-out democratic election system. Unfortunately,<br>this will probably do little good but it is a worthy effort. It is<br>our patriotic duty to resist tyranny. We must break these chains of<br>oppression and restore our government to principles based on liberty<br>and justice for all. I am not confident that standing outside buildings<br>with signs is going to provide any fundamental power shifts, as power<br>is not often transferred without a struggle. Inalienable rights are not a<br>courtesy of the Federal Government. We must stand in the streets and<br>refuse to be silenced. We must reject corporate-controlled politics<br>and focus on rebuilding a localized political structure and society. A<br>revolution is the only alternative to complete surrender and defeat.<br>Cold, hard suffering and pain will be the only hope for a real revolution,<br>and this is all but guaranteed. At this point protest must be<br>transformed into acts of defiance. We must be bold.<br>&nbsp;<br>Bell grew up in Oakwood, a small town in East Texas between Dallas and Houston. His father struggled with alcoholism and is now in recovery. His parents, who frequently fought, separated, and reunited, divorced when Bell was thirteen. His mother was left to raise Bell, along with his younger brother (currently in the Army&#x2019;s 82nd Airborne Division) and his younger sister in a one-bedroom apartment. There was little money, and his mother worked sporadically at odd jobs. There were eighteen people in his high-school graduating class. With few jobs in Oakwood, Bell, along with several of his classmates, joined the military.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;My father worked two jobs to support us; he suffered from the disease of alcoholism but is a good guy and tried to be supportive father,&#x201d; Bell says:<br>&nbsp;<br>My mom had her own set of problems. She is now living in a oneroom<br>shack. She had breast cancer four years ago and has no insurance<br>and is living in poverty. I know the system is not working. She<br>lives at the little house, a one-bedroom cabin on her mother&#x2019;s land,<br>where me and my brother lived off and on when my parents were<br>arguing. We lived in several different houses and apartments with<br>both my mom and dad. I left home when I was seventeen, drifting<br>between friends&#x2019; houses, then moved back to Oakwood, where I finished<br>high school, living with my grandparents, who had a profound<br>effect on my life and values. My life was inconsistent, chaotic, and<br>working-class. I believe this environment helped develop my character<br>and perspective. I have to give credit where it&#x2019;s due. My dad tried.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You couldn&#x2019;t stay in Oakwood, Texas, and have a job,&#x201d; he adds.<br>&nbsp;<br>Bell moved to upstate New York two years ago after leaving the Marine Corps to be near Shianne, his three-year-old daughter. He and the girl&#x2019;s mother are separated. Bell found work as a carpenter with a traveling construction crew. He earned $14.50 an hour and could sometimes make as much as $800 a week. Then the financial meltdown knocked the wind out of the local economy.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Everybody in my apartment building has had their hours cut, are unemployed, or have taken minimum-wage jobs,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;I was laid off last year. I try to find work as an independent carpenter. I don&#x2019;t have health insurance.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The dearth of work, which left him attempting to survive at times on $600 a month, saw him enlist last year in the New York National Guard, even though it means almost certain deployment to Afghanistan. The enticement of a $20,000 signing bonus was too lucrative to pass up. The National Guard unit he joined recently returned from a tour in Afghanistan.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;We are training to go back to Afghanistan,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;The fact that they are still using Army National Guard, state-level troops, to police the streets of Afghanistan is not good. These units are really overstretched. We do not get the benefits. We don&#x2019;t get health insurance like active-duty military. But the guard gets deployed just as much. Some of these guys have been on three and four tours.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I got out of the Marine Corps and went back to Texas for ten months and was involved in the John McCain campaign,&#x201d; he says:<br>&nbsp;<br>I really got disillusioned with the neoconservatism. I had never been<br>involved in politics. The idea that we needed all these troops all around<br>the world &#x201c;defending freedom,&#x201d; as they called it, when we were actually<br>engaged in nation-building and supporting special interests that drive<br>these wars, was something I began to understand. As far as foreign and<br>economic policy, I could see there was no difference between the two<br>main political parties. There is a false left/right paradigm which diverts<br>the working class from the real reasons for their hardships.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;The winters [in New York State] are really hard,&#x201d; Bell says:<br>&nbsp;<br>There are less jobs and the heating costs are high. I pay about $200 a<br>month for electric and gas. I live really cheaply. I don&#x2019;t have cable. I<br>don&#x2019;t go out or spend money that is not necessary. It is a struggle. But<br>at least I have not had to devote forty hours a week to a minimumwage<br>job that does not pay me a living wage. People here are really<br>hurting. The real underemployment rate must be at least twenty percent.<br>A lot of people are working part-time jobs when they want fulltime<br>jobs. There are many people like me, independent contractors<br>and small business owners, who can&#x2019;t file for unemployment insurance.<br>Unemployment [coverage] is not available to me because I<br>worked as a 1099, a self-employed contractor, even when I worked for<br>the construction company.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;People are scared,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;They want to live their lives, raise their children, and be happy. This is not possible. They don&#x2019;t know if they can make their next mortgage payment. They see their standard of living going down.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Bell says he and those around him are being pushed off the edge. He says he fears the social and political repercussions.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I hope there is a populist revolution,&#x201d; he says:<br>&nbsp;<br>We have to take the corporate bailouts and the money we are sending<br>overseas and use that money in our communities. If this does not<br>happen there will be more anger and eventually violence. When<br>people lose everything they start to lose it. When you can&#x2019;t find a job,<br>even though you look repeatedly, it leads to things like random<br>shootings and suicides. We will see acts of domestic terrorism. The<br>state will erode more of our civil liberties to control mass protests.<br>We are seeing some student protests, but we will see these on a wider<br>scale. I hope the protests will be constructive. I hope people will not<br>resort to extreme measures. But people will do what they have to do<br>to survive. This may mean things like food riots. The political establishment<br>better work very fast to take the pressure off.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Anger and a sense of betrayal: these are what Ernest Logan Bell and tens of millions of other disenfranchised workers express. These emotions spring from the failure of the liberal class over the past three decades to protect the minimal interests of the working and middle class as corporations dismantled the democratic state, decimated the manufacturing sector, looted the U.S. Treasury, waged imperial wars that can neither be afforded nor won, and gutted the basic laws that protected the interests of ordinary citizens. Yet the liberal class continues to speak in the prim and obsolete language of policies and issues. It refuses to defy the corporate assault. A virulent right wing, for this reason, captures and expresses the legitimate rage articulated by the disenfranchised. And the liberal class has become obsolete even as it clings to its positions of privilege within liberal institutions.<br>&nbsp;<br>Classical liberalism was formulated largely as a response to the dissolution of feudalism and church authoritarianism. It argued for noninterference or independence under the rule of law. It incorporates a few aspects of ancient Athenian philosophy as expressed by Pericles and the Sophists, but was a philosophical system that marked a radical rupture with both Aristotelian thought and medieval theology. Classical liberalism has, the philosopher John Gray writes,<br>&nbsp;<br>four principle features, or perspectives, which give it a recognizable<br>identity: it is individualist, in that it asserts the moral primacy of the<br>person against any collectivity; egalitarian, in that it confers on all<br>human beings the same basic moral status; universalist, affirming the<br>moral unity of the species; and meliorist, in that it asserts the openended<br>improvability, by use of critical reason, of human life.3<br>&nbsp;<br>Thomas Hobbes (1588&#x2013;1679), John Locke (1632&#x2013;1704), and Baruch Spinoza (1632&#x2013;1677) laid the foundations for classical liberalism. The work of these theorists was expanded in the eighteenth century by the Scottish moral philosophers, the French <i>philosophes, </i>and the early architects of American democracy. The philosopher John Stuart Mill (1806&#x2013;1873) redefined liberalism in the nineteenth century to call for the redistribution of wealth and the promotion of the welfare state.<br>&nbsp;<br>The liberal era, which flourished in the later part of the nineteenth century and the early years of the twentieth, was characterized by the growth of mass movements and social reforms that addressed working conditions in factories, the organizing of labor unions, women&#x2019;s rights,universal education, housing for the poor, public health campaigns, and socialism. This liberal era effectively ended with World War I. The war, which shattered liberal optimism about the inevitability of human progress, also consolidated state and corporate control over economic, political, cultural, and social affairs. It created mass culture, fostered through the consumer society the cult of the self, led the nation into an era of permanent war, and used fear and mass propaganda to cow citizens and silence independent and radical voices within the liberal class.

Covering sex, love, food, fitness, self-understanding, spiritual and social growth, and your brain. In <i>Prime Time,</i> she offers a vision for successful living and maturing, A to Z.<br><br>Highlighting new research and stories from her own life and from the lives of others, Jane Fonda explores how the critical years from 45 and 50, and especially from 60 and beyond, can be times when we truly become the energetic, loving, fulfilled people we were meant to be. Covering the 11 key ingredients for vital living, Fonda invites you to consider with her how to live a more insightful, healthy, and fully integrated life, a life lived more profoundly in touch with ourselves, our bodies, minds, and spirits, and with our talents, friends, and communities. <br><br>In her research, Fonda discovered two metaphors, the arch and the staircase, that became for her two visions of life. She shows how to see your life the staircase way, as one of continual ascent. She explains how she came to understand the earlier decades of her life by performing a life review, and she shows how you can do a life review too. She reveals how her own life review enabled her to let go of old patterns, to see what means the most to her, and then to cultivate new goals and dreams, to make the most of the mature years. For there has been a longevity revolution, and the average human life expectancy has jumped by years. Fonda asks, what we are meant to do with this precious gift of time? And she writes about how we can navigate the fertile voids that life periodically presents to us. She makes suggestions about exercise (including three key movements for optimal health), diet (how to eat by color), meditation, and how learning new things and creating fresh pathways in your brain can add quality to your life. Fonda writes of positivity, and why many people are happier in the second half of their lives than they have ever been before.<br><br>In her #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling memoir, <i>My Life So Far, </i>Jane<i> </i>Fonda focused on the first half of her extraordinary life&#x2014;what she called Acts I and II&#x2014;with an eye toward preparing for a vibrant Act III. Now we have a thoughtfully articulated memoir and guide for how to make all of your life, and especially Act III, <i>Prime Time</i>.</p></p><p><strong>A Letter from Jane Fonda</strong> <p>In my memoir, <em>My Life So Far</em>, I defined my life in three acts: Act I, from birth to 29 years; Act II, from 30 to 59 years; and Act III, from 60 until the end. It really seemed to resonate with people, and a few years after the book came out, my editor at Random House, Kate Medina, came to me and suggested I write a book focusing more on the Third Act. I was interested in doing this because I was already well into my Third Act and relished the challenge to dig deeper, to understand its meaning, to learn how to make the most of it, and to navigate the inevitable challenges of aging--what is negotiable and what isn't.</p> <p>Third Acts are important. They can make sense out of what may seem like discordant, confusing First Acts. Third Acts can, if we think about it, allow us to discover who we really are. Entered with intention, Third Acts can help us become midwives to ourselves before we die. </p> <p>I knew that this exploration is especially important now, because in the last century, the average life expectancy has expanded by 35 years! Think about it: At the time of our founding fathers, the average person died at around 35 years of age. Now we can expect to live, on average, 80 years! An entire second adult lifetime! This amazing gift of time means that Third Acts have gained a whole new significance. </p> <p>Yet we are pioneers within this new reality. We need a road map to show us how to navigate the new terrain. I wanted to create this roadmap--for myself, as well as for my readers. We who are approaching our Third Acts (or are already in the midst of them, as I am), can show the way for those coming up--our children, grandchildren, nieces, and nephews.</p> <p>We are still living with the old paradigm of aging, which can best be described as an arch: We are born, we peak at midlife, and then decline--age as pathology. </p> <p>While researching my book, I discovered another paradigm, one that is far more appropriate given the longevity revolution. It is the image of a staircase, an upward ascension until the end--age as potential--for wisdom, authenticity, and wholeness. </p> <p>This metaphor for aging is one that I myself am experiencing, and I wanted to understand why this is so and write about it. Yes, my body is experiencing the effects of age, but after coming through a very difficult, painful midlife, I find that I am happier, more peaceful, and more content than I have ever been. My relationships are deeper and less anxious. I find this is true, by the way, for most of my older friends. This was not at all what I had expected at this stage of life! Yes, we forget things, but we also remember a lot and with more vividness now because we know why we want to remember them. Yes, we lose eyesight, but we gain insight. We learn what we need and what to let go of. We tend to make lemons into lemonade instead of mountains out of molehills. Scientists call this the Positivity Factor and their research shows it to be the case for most women and men over 50, regardless of their circumstances, even in the face of physical challenges. How, I wanted to know, can we ensure this is true for us? </p> <p>I sat myself down and made a list of all the things I wanted to know about aging, from sex to exercise; from nutrition to wisdom. A to Z. I talked to scientists, doctors, priests. To centenarians. To men and women in long-term marriages, and those who were looking for love or needing a way out of loneliness. I write about my own experiences and much more.</p> <p>I realized that to better navigate our Third Act, we benefit by reviewing the first two acts. I call this doing a Life Review, and it can profoundly alter our understanding of ourselves, our past, and what we need to do to complete ourselves as we ascend the staircase to the end. This is why Prime Time includes a discussion of Acts I and II and the developmental issues that lie within each of them, as well as questions you can ask yourself about how you were at those times. Understanding these things can help you swing into your Third Act as prepared as possible to make it your Prime Time.</p><p><b>Jane Fonda </b>is an Oscar- and Emmy-winning actress and highly successful producer.

His father and his grandfather were both pastors and at the age of twenty, he became the pastor of the famous New Park Street Church in London. The congregation quickly grew out of the building and moved to Exeter Hall where he frequently preached to audiences of over 10,000 people. In 1861, the congregation moved to newly constructed Metropolitan Tabernacle, which was the largest indoor congregation ever reached with human voice up to that time in history. The Tabernacle was able to accommodate up to 6,000 people. The New Park Street and the Metropolitan Tabernacle Pulpits, where Spurgeon preached, collected his sermons during his ministry, and they filled 63 volumes with 20-25 million words in them. His series stands as the largest set of books by a single author in the history of Christianity. His own personal library contained over 12,000 volumes. Spurgeon also became known to a wider audience with the publication of &#34;Ploughman&#39;s Talk&#34; in 1869 and &#34;The Treasury of David.&#34; During Spurgeon&#39;s last years, he suffered severe physical pain from a gout attack. He was growing increasing ill and on January 31, 1892, Charles Haddon Spurgeon died.</p><h2>The Bias Against Guns: Why Almost Everything You&#39;Ve Heard About Gun Control Is Wrong</h2><p>"If you want the truth the anti&#x2013;gunners don't want you to know...you need a copy of <i>The Bias Against Guns</i>" &#x2014;<b><i>Sean Hannity</i></b><i> of Fox News Channel's</i> Hannity &amp; Colmes</p><p>Following up on his controversial study More Guns, Less Crime, economist Lott argues that widespread gun ownership prevents crime. He cites survey data and news reports to argue that the fear that victims might be armed strongly deters criminals, and that guns are used in self-defense or to ward off criminal threats about 2.3 million times a year. Because they impede law-abiding citizens' access to guns, even mild gun-control regulations-assault weapons bans, "one-gun-a-month" laws-actually increase crime, according to Lott, while right-to-carry laws lower crime and help prevent (or violently terminate) terrorist attacks and "rampage" shootings. Even measures to keep guns away from children, like "gun-free school zones" and "safe storage" laws that require guns to be locked away, are misguided because children need guns for self-defense (he cites news reports of kids as young as 11 gunning down criminals). The benefits of untrammeled gun availability are clear, Lott insists, and only the anti-gun bias and selective reporting by the media and government officials have kept this fact out of public consciousness. Lott supports his bold claims with elaborate statistical analyses that tease sometimes small effects out of the welter of factors that influence crime rates; there are lots of graphs and tables, and much space is devoted to scholarly discussions of statistical methodologies. Many readers will find these sections rough going, but Lott's provocative thesis is sure to stir interest among second-amendment stalwarts and gun-control supporters alike. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Tigana</h2><p>Allesan, son of the king of Tigana, and other survivors of the forgotten world band together to plot the demise of Brandin of Ygrath</p><p>Guy Gavriel Kay was born and raised in Canada.

Guy Gavriel Kay lives in Toronto<p>PROLOGUE</p><p>Both moons were high, dimming the light of all but the brightest stars. The campfires burned on either side of the river, stretching away into the night. Quietly flowing, the Deisa caught the moonlight and the orange of the nearer fires and cast them back in wavery, sinuous ripples. And all the lines of light led to his eyes, to where he was sitting on the riverbank, hands about his knees, thinking about dying and the life he&#x2019;d lived.</p><p>There was a glory to the night, Saevar thought, breathing deeply of the mild summer air, smelling water and water flowers and grass, watching the reflection of blue moonlight and silver on the river, hearing the Deisa&#x2019;s murmurous flow and the distant singing from around the fires. There was singing on the other side of the river too, he noted, listening to the enemy soldiers north of them. It was curiously hard to impute any absolute sense of evil to those harmonizing voices, or to hate them quite as blindly as being a soldier seemed to require. He wasn&#x2019;t really a soldier, though, and he had never been good at hating.</p><p>He couldn&#x2019;t actually see any figures moving in the grass across the river, but he could see the fires and it wasn&#x2019;t hard to judge how many more of them lay north of the Deisa than there were here behind him, where his people waited for the dawn.</p><p>Almost certainly their last. He had no illusions; none of them did. Not since the battle at this same river five days ago. All they had was courage, and a leader whose defiant gallantry was almost matched by the two young sons who were here with him.</p><p>They were beautiful boys, both of them. Saevar regretted that he had never had the chance to sculpt either of them. The Prince he had done of course, many times. The Prince called him a friend. It could not be said, Saevar thought, that he had lived a useless or an empty life. He&#x2019;d had his art, the joy of it and the spur, and had lived to see it praised by the great ones of his province, indeed of the whole peninsula.</p><p>And he&#x2019;d known love, as well. He thought of his wife and then of his own two children. The daughter whose eyes had taught him part of the meaning of life on the day she&#x2019;d been born fifteen years ago. And his son, too young by a year to have been allowed to come north to war. Saevar remembered the look on the boy&#x2019;s face when they had parted. He supposed that much the same expression had been in his own eyes. He&#x2019;d embraced both children, and then he&#x2019;d held his wife for a long time, in silence; all the words had been spoken many times through all the years. Then he&#x2019;d turned, quickly, so they would not see his tears, and mounted his horse, unwontedly awkward with a sword on his hip, and had ridden away with his Prince to war against those who had come upon them from over the sea.</p><p>He heard a light tread, behind him and to his left, from where the campfires were burning and voices were threading in song to the tune a syrenya played. He turned to the sound.</p><p>&#x201c;Be careful,&#x201d; he called softly. &#x201c;Unless you want to trip over a sculptor.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Saevar?&#x201d; an amused voice murmured. A voice he knew well.</p><p>&#x201c;It is, my lord Prince,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;Can you remember a night so beautiful?&#x201d;</p><p>Valentin walked over&#x2014;there was more than enough light by which to see&#x2014;and sank neatly down on the grass beside him. &#x201c;Not readily,&#x201d; he agreed. &#x201c;Can you see? Vidomni&#x2019;s waxing matches Ilarion&#x2019;s wane. The two moons together would make one whole.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A strange whole that would be,&#x201d; Saevar said.</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2019;Tis a strange night.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is it? Is the night changed by what we do down here? We mortal men in our folly?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The way we see it is,&#x201d; Valentin said softly, his quick mind engaged by the question. &#x201c;The beauty we find is shaped, at least in part, by what we know the morning will bring.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What will it bring, my lord?&#x201d; Saevar asked, before he could stop himself. Half hoping, he realized, as a child hopes, that his dark-haired Prince of grace and pride would have an answer yet to what lay waiting across the river. An answer to all those Ygrathen voices and all the Ygrathen fires burning north of them. An answer, most of all, to the terrible King of Ygrath and his sorcery, and the hatred that <i>he</i> at least would have no trouble summoning tomorrow.</p><p>Valentin was silent, looking out at the river. Overhead Saevar saw a star fall, angling across the sky west of them to plunge, most likely, into the wideness of the sea. He was regretting the question; this was no time to be putting a burden of false certitude upon the Prince.</p><p>Just as he was about to apologize, Valentin spoke, his voice measured and low, so as not to carry beyond their small circle of dark.</p><p>&#x201c;I have been walking among the fires, and Corsin and Loredan have been doing the same, offering comfort and hope and such laughter as we can bring to ease men into sleep. There is not much else we can do.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They are good boys, both of them,&#x201d; Saevar offered. &#x201c;I was thinking that I&#x2019;ve never sculpted either of them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry for that,&#x201d; Valentin said. &#x201c;If anything lasts for any length of time after us it will be art such as yours. Our books and music, Orsaria&#x2019;s green and white tower in Avalle.&#x201d; He paused, and returned to his original thought. &#x201c;They <i>are</i> brave boys. They are also sixteen and nineteen, and if I could have I would have left them behind with their brother&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and your son.&#x201d;</p><p>It was one of the reasons Saevar loved him: that Valentin would remember his own boy, and think of him with the youngest prince, even now, at such a time as this.</p><p>To the east and a little behind them, away from the fires, a trialla suddenly began to sing and both men fell silent, listening to the silver of that sound. Saevar&#x2019;s heart was suddenly full, he was afraid that he might shame himself with tears, that they would be mistaken for fear.</p><p>Valentin said, &#x201c;But I haven&#x2019;t answered your question, old friend. Truth seems easier here in the dark, away from the fires and all the need I have been seeing there. Saevar, I am so sorry, but the truth is that almost all of the morning&#x2019;s blood will be ours, and I am afraid it will be all of ours. Forgive me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There is nothing to forgive,&#x201d; Saevar said quickly, and as firmly as he could. &#x201c;This is not a war of your making, nor one you could avoid or undo. And besides, I may not be a soldier but I hope I am not a fool. It was an idle question: I can see the answer for myself, my lord. In the fires across the river.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And the sorcery,&#x201d; Valentin added quietly. &#x201c;More that, than the fires. We could beat back greater numbers, even weary and wounded as we are from last week&#x2019;s battle. But Brandin&#x2019;s magic is with them now. The lion has come himself, not the cub, and because the cub is dead there must be blood for the morning sun. Should I have surrendered last week? To the boy?&#x201d;</p><p>Saevar turned to look at the Prince in the blended moonlight, disbelieving. He was speechless for a moment, then found his voice. &#x201c;I would have gone home from that surrender,&#x201d; he said, with resolution, &#x201c;and walked into the Palace by the Sea, and smashed every sculpture I ever made of you.&#x201d;</p><p>A second later he heard an odd sound. It took him a moment to realize that Valentin was laughing, because it wasn&#x2019;t laughter like any Saevar had ever heard.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, my friend,&#x201d; the Prince said, at length, &#x201c;I think I knew you would say that. Oh, our pride. Our terrible pride. Will they remember that most about us, do you think, after we are gone?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Perhaps,&#x201d; Saevar said. &#x201c;But they will remember. The one thing we know with certainty is that they will remember us. Here in the peninsula, and in Ygrath, and Quileia, even west over the sea, in Barbadior and its Empire. We will leave a name.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And we leave our children,&#x201d; Valentin said. &#x201c;The younger ones. Sons and daughters who will remember us. Babes in arms our wives and grandfathers will teach when they grow up to know the story of the River Deisa, what happened here, and, even more&#x2014;what we were in this province before the fall. Brandin of Ygrath can destroy us tomorrow, he can overrun our home, but he cannot take away our name, or the memory of what we have been.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He cannot,&#x201d; Saevar echoed, feeling an odd, unexpected lift to his heart. &#x201c;I am sure that you are right. We are not the last free generation. There will be ripples of tomorrow that run down all the years. Our children&#x2019;s children will remember us, and will not lie tamely under the yoke.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And if any of them seem inclined to,&#x201d; Valentin added in a different tone, &#x201c;there will be the children or grandchildren of a certain sculptor who will smash their heads for them, of stone or otherwise.&#x201d;</p><p>Saevar smiled in the darkness. He wanted to laugh, but it was not in him just then. &#x201c;I hope so, my lord, if the goddesses and the god allow. Thank you. Thank you for saying that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No thanks, Saevar. Not between us and not this night. The Triad guard and shelter you tomorrow, and after, and guard and shelter all that you have loved.&#x201d;</p><p>Saevar swallowed. &#x201c;You know you are a part of that, my lord. A part of what I have loved.&#x201d;</p><p>Valentin did not reply. Only, after a moment, he leaned forward and kissed Saevar upon the brow. Then he held up a hand and the sculptor, his eyes blurring, raised his own hand and touched his Prince&#x2019;s palm to palm in farewell. Valentin rose and was gone, a shadow in moonlight, back towards the fires of his army.</p><p>The singing seemed to have stopped, on both sides of the river. It was very late. Saevar knew he should be making his own way back and settling down for a few snatched hours of sleep. It was hard to leave though, to rise and surrender the perfect beauty of this last night. The river, the moons, the arch of stars, the fireflies and all the fires.</p><p>In the end he decided to stay there by the water. He sat alone in the summer darkness on the banks of the River Deisa, with his strong hands loosely clasped about his knees.

Not the white-robed priests of Eanna, nor those of dark Morian of Portals, nor the priestesses of Adaon, the god.</p><p>There was no particular surprise in Astibar town when these tidings came with the word of the Duke&#x2019;s passing. Exiled Sandre&#x2019;s rage at the Triad and its clergy through the last eighteen years of his life was far from being a secret. And impiety had never been a thing from which Sandre d&#x2019;Astibar, even in the days of his power, had shied away.</p><p>The city was overflowing with people from the outlying distrada and far beyond on the eve of the Festival of Vines. In the crowded taverns and khav rooms truths and lies about the Duke were traded back and forth like wool and spice by folk who had never seen his face and who would have once paled with justifiable terror at a summons to the Ducal court in Astibar.</p><p>All his days Duke Sandre had occasioned talk and speculation through the whole of the peninsula men called the Palm&#x2014;and there was nothing to alter that fact at the time of his dying, for all that Alberico of Barbadior had come with an army from that Empire overseas and exiled Sandre into the distrada eighteen years before. When power is gone the memory of power lingers.</p><p>Perhaps because of this, and certainly because he tended to be cautious and circumspect in all his ways, Alberico, who held four of the nine provinces in an iron grip and was vying with Brandin of Ygrath for the ninth, acted with a precise regard for protocol.</p><p>By noon of the day the Duke died, a messenger from Alberico was seen to have ridden out by the eastern gate of the city. A messenger bearing the blue-silver banner of mourning and carrying, no one doubted, carefully chosen words of condolence to Sandre&#x2019;s children and grandchildren now gathered at their broad estate seven miles beyond the walls.</p><p>In The Paelion, the khav room where the wittier sort were gathering that season, it was cynically observed that the Tyrant would have been more likely to send a company of his own Barbadian mercenaries&#x2014;not just a single message-bearer&#x2014;were the living Sandreni not such a feckless lot. Before the appreciative, eye-to-who-might-be-listening, ripple of amusement at that had quite died away, one itinerant musician&#x2014;there were scores of them in Astibar that week&#x2014;had offered to wager all he might earn in the three days to come, that from the Island of Chiara would arrive condolences in verse before the Festival was over.</p><p>&#x201c;Too rich an opportunity,&#x201d; the rash newcomer explained, cradling a steaming mug of khav laced with one of the dozen or so liqueurs that lined the shelves behind the bar of The Paelion. &#x201c;Brandin will be incapable of letting slip a chance like this to remind Alberico&#x2014;and the rest of us&#x2014;that though the two of them have divided our peninsula the share of art and learning is quite tilted west towards Chiara. Mark my words&#x2014;and wager who will&#x2014;we&#x2019;ll have a knottily rhymed verse from stout Doarde or some silly acrostic thing of Camena&#x2019;s to puzzle out, with Sandre spelled six ways and backwards, before the music stops in Astibar three days from now.&#x201d;</p><p>There was laughter, though again it was guarded, even on the eve of the Festival, when a long tradition that Alberico of Barbadior had circumspectly indulged allowed more license than elsewhere in the year. A few men with heads for figures did some rapid calculations of sailing-time and the chances of the autumn seas north of Senzio province and down through the Archipelago, and the musician found his wager quickly covered and recorded on the slate on the wall of The Paelion that existed for just such a purpose in a city prone to gambling.</p><p>But shortly after that all wagers and mocking chatter were forgotten. Someone in a steep cap with a curled feather flung open the doors of the khav room, shouted for attention, and when he had it reported that the Tyrant&#x2019;s messenger had just been seen returning through the same eastern gate from which he had so lately sallied forth. That the messenger was riding at an appreciably greater speed than hitherto, and that, not three miles to his rear was the funerary procession of Duke Sandre d&#x2019;Astibar being brought by his last request to lie a night and a day in state in the city he once had ruled.</p></p><h2>Prospect: The Journal of an Artist</h2><p>Based upon journals she wrote at the age of seventy, the author&#39;s reflections on her life as an artist, mother, grandmother, and teacher provide a poignant recollection of home, friends, and the things that inspired her as an artist. 10,000 first printing.</p><p>Anne Truitt [1921-2004] had her first solo exhibition at the Andre Emmerich Gallery in New York in 1963. Her work is in the collections of major museums around the world, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York; the National Gallery of Art, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, and the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, DC; the Dallas Museum of Art, and the Art Institute of Chicago. The recipient of many grants, she was the director of the artists colony Yaddo for several years in the early 1990s. Today the Estate of Anne Truitt is represented by Matthew Marks Gallery.The sculptor's third meditation on life and art (after Daybook, 1982; Turn, 1986) triumphs in its clearheadedness but fails to satisfy in its paths of resolution. As in Turn, Truitt explores the end of the life cycle, this time structuring her work around her 70th year, when she is regaled for decades of achievement with a major retrospective in New York yet penalized with mandatory retirement at the University of Maryland. The gravity of the events is unsettling; she calls herself ``officially old.'' Although she muses briefly throughout the memoir on the physical manifestations of aging- -diminished energy and the need for improved safety measures in the house--she concentrates on how her mind refines itself with age. This means engaging in the ``interplay [between past and present] that is making aging the most interesting thing that has ever happened to me.'' Such interplay involves central elements of her life--her children, her artistic career, the artists' colony Yaddo (for which she had been acting director), historical figures who embody her personal truths, the natural world around her. Her observations are wise in their understanding of limits and psychology, and true to her lifelong admiration for the Stoic philosophers, but the effect by book's end is somewhat cramped and final. Appreciated are her patches of animation, which show up in her analyses of her artworks and the work of critics, particularly those who attempt the ``invidious'' practice of ascribing motive to an artist's work. Also welcome are the quirky anecdotes, like that of the pilgrimage to one of her grade-school teachers, who informed her that--despite Truitt's view of herself as a youthful rebel--she had not been an interesting child. Though at times enervating in its stoicism and sureness, this invites thought about the intellectual flavor of life's final years. It is an honorable goal; if only this particular trip had been more involving for those acompanying Truitt. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

As a result, our country has generally worked to keep the military out of law enforcement. But according to investigative reporter Radley Balko, over the last several decades, America's cops have increasingly come to resemble ground troops. The consequences have been dire: the home is no longer a place of sanctuary, the Fourth Amendment has been gutted, and police today have been conditioned to see the citizens they serve as an other&#x2014;an enemy.<br><br>Today's armored-up policemen are a far cry from the constables of early America. The unrest of the 1960s brought about the invention of the SWAT unit&#x2014;which in turn led to the debut of military tactics in the ranks of police officers. Nixon's War on Drugs, Reagan's War on Poverty, Clinton's COPS program, the post&#x2013;9/11 security state under Bush and Obama: by degrees, each of these innovations expanded and empowered police forces, always at the expense of civil liberties. And these are just four among a slew of reckless programs.<br><br>In <i>Rise of the Warrior Cop</i>, Balko shows how politicians' ill-considered policies and relentless declarations of war against vague enemies like crime, drugs, and terror have blurred the distinction between cop and soldier. His fascinating, frightening narrative shows how over a generation, a creeping battlefield mentality has isolated and alienated American police officers and put them on a collision course with the values of a free society.<br></p><p><b>Radley Balko</b> is an award-winning investigative journalist who writes about civil liberties, police, prosecutors, and the broader criminal justice system. He is currently a writer and investigative reporter for the <i>Washington Post</i>. Previously, he was a senior writer and investigative reporter for the <i> Huffington Post</i>, senior editor for <i>Reason</i> magazine, and a policy analyst for the Cato Institute.

Balko makes a compelling case that in America today there are too many SWAT teams operating with too little accountability, further exposing the country to the dangers this magazine identified in 1996. No, America today isn't a police state,' he writes in the concluding chapter. Far from it. But it would be foolish to wait until it becomes one to get concerned.' One need not be a libertarian to appreciate the warning.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Diane Goldstein, Huffington Post</b><br> Rise of the Warrior Cop asks many questions about the proper role of law enforcement and the effect of the drug war, America's longest war, on our communities Balko interweaves history, the Constitution, and case law to create an account of how the massive expansion of SWAT teams occurred as the perfect storm of politics, ideology and federal fiscal coercion.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>New York Journal of Books</i></b><br> This historic review of America's police and police tactics is clear and direct in its nondismissal narrative. This is not an anti-police book, but a serious look at the growth and use of SWAT and military style tactics, at America's war on drugs, and the financial incentives that created the new community police force&#x201d; This book is highly recommended for the historic value of the information; it is clear, concise, and well argued. Whether you are a lifetime, card carrying member of the ACLU or the newest law and order politician The Rise of the Warrior Cop provides a clear timeline and important information making it a must read.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br> 'Are cops constitutional?'

Romero, Executive Director, American Civil Liberties Union</b><br> Excessively militarized policing is easy to ignore when a SWAT team is ramming down someone else's door or tear-gassing someone else's protest. What makes Rise of the Warrior Cop so important is that Mr. Balko makes police militarization real for all of us. This is a meticulously researched history book that casts needed light on a central civil liberties issue.&nbsp; Police militarization is something we should all care about, and Rise of the Warrior Cop will show you why.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Arianna Huffington, president and editor-in-chief, Huffington Post</b><br> With his thorough reporting and compelling storytelling gifts, Radley Balko builds a powerful narrative of the militarization of our police forces, which both liberals and conservatives have allowed to flourish. And he shows the chilling results of both parties' unwillingness to stand up to increasingly aggressive police tactics that often pit cops against those they are sworn to protect.&#x201d;<br><br>One of Gizmodo's Best Books of 2013<br><br><b>Sarah Stillman, NewYorker.com</b><br> A fascinating and at times wrenching new book.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>The Economist</i></b><br> Mr Balko manages to avoid the clich�s of both right and left, and provokes genuine outrage at the misuse of state power in its most brutal and unaccountable form: heavily armed police raiding the homes of unarmed, non-violent suspects on the flimsiest of pretexts, and behaving more like an occupying army in hostile territory than guardians of public safety. Rise of the Warrior Cop&#x201d;, Mr Balko's interesting first book, explains what policies led to the militarisation of America's police. To his credit, he focuses his outrage not on the police themselves, but on politicians and the phoney, wasteful drug war they created.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>American Conservative</i></b><br> <i>Rise of the Warrior Cop</i> diagnoses a grave threat to our constitutional rights. If Americans still possess the wisdom of our Founders, we will heed Balko's warning and turn back our drift towards a police state.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Charleston (WV) Gazette</i></b><br> For Americans who care about their core political liberties, Balko's book is a must-read.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Pacific Standard</i></b><br> Fascinating and sometimes terrifying&#x201d;<br><br><b>StoptheDrugWar.org</b><br> In Balko's hands, an entertaining and illuminating story as well as depressing and frightening told with verve and gusto, meticulously researched, and filled with telling historical detail Rise of the Warrior Cop is an important book and deserves to be read by small government conservatives, civil libertarian liberals, police commanders, and politicians alike.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Simple Justice blog</b><br> It's critical to appreciate the history of policing, to understand that what we now see as normal and inescapable wasn't always the case. For most of our history, this country did not have a group of people with shields and guns who wandered the streets ordering people about. If there is any hope of changing the course of the militarization of law enforcement, it will come from a greater understanding of why this was never meant to be the internal norm of this country, and that it doesn't have to be. Radley Balko has done an exceptional job of making the case.

Civil libertarians on the left and limited government conservatives on the right should pay especially close attention to Radley Balko's examination of the link between the the war on drugs' and law enforcement's increased use of police state tactics.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Norm Stamper, thirty-four-year police veteran and police chief of Seattle, Washington, 1994 2000</b><br> A rich, pertinent history, with unexpected but critically important observations of the increased militarization of American policing.

A huge contribution.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Glenn Greenwald, constitutional lawyer, <i>Guardian</i> columnist, and <i>New York Times</i>-bestselling author</b><br> Vibrant and compelling. There is no vital trend in American society more overlooked than the militarization of our domestic police forces, and there is no journalist in America who is more knowledgeable and passionate about this topic than Radley Balko.

At my first World Cup in Spain in 1982, I could not follow the ball because the skill of the players, the things they could do with their insteps and knees and foreheads, was beyond my comprehension. Over the years, in eight World Cups all over the globe, I learned to continuously take mental note of who touched the ball, and how, and where it went&#x2014;creating an endless sixty-second loop of memory that could be erased when those touches led nowhere.</p> <p>Goals are always precious, always unique, and often come out of nowhere because of a nifty steal and a laser pass at the far end. You cannot afford to let your mind wander between plays, as I do at American football games, when I read a few paragraphs of a newspaper between plays that Coach sends in. In soccer, you must watch the ball every second because you just don&#x2019;t know.</p> <p>Was I rooting for the Yanks? Not exactly. American soccer writers are pretty independent; they criticize and report, but they also spend time around the players, and generally admire them for their pursuit of the game. The men&#x2019;s national team and the highly successful women&#x2019;s team are the sons and daughters of the hybrid nation&#x2014;never more so than on the epic all-American romp that was about to happen in distant Pretoria.</p> <p>Reporters and fans had watched the squad change kaleidoscopically from match to match, from year to year. The eleven players on the field were survivors of a long march, and some who had helped win qualifying matches did not make it to South Africa. "Good friends we had, good friends we lost along the way," as Bob Marley put it.</p> <p>Now, as the vuvuzelas yowled like hounds of hell, I spotted Tim Howard, the latest in a pipeline of supple American goalkeepers, prowling the goal line, anxiety on his face.</p> <p>A few weeks earlier, when the United States played a tune-up in Connecticut, team officials brought in Bill Russell, perhaps the most successful American athlete in history, who had won eleven professional basketball championships as the center for the Boston Celtics and who had previously led his team to two college championships and one Olympic gold medal. A rebounder-poet named Tom Meschery once described Russell as "an eagle with a beard." Now the eagle&#x2019;s beard was white, and he stooped a bit as he strode across the field, but he still looked like the man who could swat the ball out of Wilt Chamberlain&#x2019;s hands&#x2014;fierce, purposeful, distant.</p> <p>A few steps behind Russell was Tim Howard, part African American, part Hungarian, the nicest of people, who always talked civilly with reporters who covered the U.S. team.</p> <p>Any fool can be a straight man. I knew Howard had been a star basketball player in high school back in New Jersey. I also knew he could handle my break-the-ice question.</p> <p>"Did you tell Russell you could dunk on him?"</p> <p>Howard looked at me quizzically, as if to ask, <i>Are you crazy?</i> Then he smiled and told us how Russell had talked about focus and intensity and pride. The main thing was, Howard had studied the aging eagle, up close.</p> <p>Every four years, the World Cup moves to a different corner of the earth, becoming part of the history and politics of the host country. The spectators get a quick rush from watching the best-known athletes in the world march onto the field holding the hands of appropriately diverse and always appealing children. Giant yellow Fair Play cards are flashed, the pageantry so blatant yet somehow effective, making people around the world temporarily overlook the demonstrated venality and opacity of FIFA (F�deration Internationale de Football Association), the governing body of soccer.</p> <p>Late in 1994, I wrote the script for a Brazilian documentary about the World Cup in the United States, just concluded. The title was <i>Two Billion Hearts</i>. I have encountered those thumping hearts in subways in Mexico City, at wurst stands in Germany. In 2010, I was feeling the pride of the African continent; I could sense two billion hearts, all pounding, including my own.</p> <p><br>The whole world plays soccer. Two hundred seven nations were registered and ranked as of May 2010, with Brazil ranked first, possibly out of habit, and surging Spain right behind. Six nations were tied for last&#x2014;San Marino, Anguilla, Montserrat, American Samoa, Central African Republic, and Papua New Guinea.</p> <p>The United States was ranked fourteenth going into that World Cup while Algeria was ranked thirtieth, which made for a delicious first world&#x2013;third world matchup. Algeria, although at the opposite end of a vast continent, was representing Africa.</p> <p>Organized soccer had talked for decades about Africa being the future of the sport. Now FIFA had belatedly honored that commitment, making South Africa the host&#x2014;a mixed blessing of worldwide exposure and crushing cost. Either way, the world was watching a World Cup in Africa, and the event seemed normal in just about every way, except that the season was winter instead of summer, and fans had to bundle up.</p> <p>This match was being played in Pretoria, the executive capital of South Africa, in Loftus Versfeld Stadium, built for rugby, named for an early player and administrator of that white man&#x2019;s sport.</p> <p>During the terrible struggle over apartheid, officers on horseback had stormed through downtown Pretoria, lashing out at demonstrators. Films of that violence are shown at the Apartheid Museum in Johannesburg. In 1995, this stadium was used for several matches as South Africa improbably won the Rugby World Cup and Nelson Mandela donned rugby gear, setting a tone of unity and accommodation. Fifteen years later, a soccer team from North Africa was giving fits to the United States of America.</p> <p>It was getting dark, and cold, and very late. The sideline official designated four minutes of supplemental injury time, every second a bonus to the desperate Americans. The red-clad American fans hooted, but many more fans cheered as an Algerian defender played the ball backward to his own keeper, a common stalling tactic.</p> <p>The Algerian players worked the ball down the right side. Normally, one of the strongest players would dribble into the corner and kill some seconds by grappling with the defenders. However, one player saw an opening, set up a parabolic pass across the goalmouth, where a teammate met it with his forehead. Cristiano Ronaldo or one of the German strikers might have hammered the ball into the far corner to finish off the Americans, but the Algerian lofted it directly toward Tim Howard&#x2019;s chest.</p> <p>Howard has a trace of Tourette&#x2019;s syndrome and normally displays no visible symptoms except perhaps facial twitches now and then. As the ball approached, the condition did not affect his dunker hands. He got the feel of the ball and danced a few steps forward, glancing downfield. In another time and place, the eagle with a beard would have spotted Sam Jones or John Havlicek streaking downcourt. Tim Howard spotted Landon Donovan going in motion.</p> <p>There was no time for a buildup, only desperation. Howard dished the ball with an overhand motion, bouncing it up the middle, where Donovan, with his sprinter&#x2019;s stride, caught up with it, forty yards downfield.</p> <p><br>Root for the story. That&#x2019;s the rule for any reporter. The obvious story of this day would be Algeria knocking out the Americans. Then I would write a column asking why Our Lads, with all that money, all those youth programs, were actually deteriorating as a world soccer power since their high point in 2002, when the U.S. team reached the World Cup quarterfinals in South Korea.</p> <p>In our own provincial little World Series of baseball, back in 1986, I had the vague sense the Boston Red Sox were still haunted by some dank vapor, cursed for sending Babe Ruth to the Yankees. I would have enjoyed writing about their first championship after sixty-eight years of failure; instead, I wrote about the fluke ground ball that squiggled through some poor soul&#x2019;s legs. In baseball, there is no ticking clock, but in this sport of surprises the stopwatch was in the hand of the lone official on the field. Wracked by jet lag, I had no journalistic premonitions as I sat in Loftus Versfeld Stadium. The match was moving in real time, as Landon Donovan picked up the pace.</p> <p>He was the most beautiful of athletes, with the grace of an 880-yard racer rather than the churning legs of a sprinter. In a sport of ethnics, among sons of immigrants and holders of dual passports, Donovan was a beach boy, happiest when he could smell the Pacific. He had tried the challenge of soccer in Europe but declared himself a homebody, a Californian. He was intense, private, but it was a mistake to underestimate his drive, his toughness. Donovan had learned the second language of California, Spanish, from growing up around Mexican kids, and he was not afraid of sandlot roughness or bilingual jibes from hostile crowds in arenas like Azteca Stadium in Mexico City. He almost seemed to like it.</p> <p>Donovan was the most potent attacking force the United States had ever sent onto a field. He could take corner kicks or find an open seam on the field or fight off an elbow to capture a loose ball&#x2014;or just outrun everybody. In a nation that has produced great athletes in many other sports, he was the closest approximation to a star. In World Cup terms, he was America&#x2019;s Maradona, America&#x2019;s Baggio, America&#x2019;s Zidane. Tim Howard made sure the right man had the ball.</p> <p>Donovan caught up with the ball at full speed, opening up the field. In the past fifteen minutes, the United States had seemed to gain the edge in cardio fitness. Donovan raced past the Algerian defenders. All over the world, four billion eyes began to widen, the quick rush of this sport.</p> <p>The temptation for Donovan, for any footballer, was to try too much. A basketball player knows he has enough energy and skill to race down the court and dunk, which is why scores often exceed one hundred points, from repetitive brilliance. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, a soccer player might overreach, but Donovan found the incredible presence to lay the ball off to his right, where Jozy Altidore was racing.</p> <p>A big striker of Haitian background, born in New Jersey, Altidore had traveled around the soccer diaspora, looking to be a star. Not known for speed or finesse, Altidore caught up with Donovan&#x2019;s ball, controlled it with a touch far beyond his norm, and took a swerve toward the goal, past defenders, making the run of his life.</p> <p>Again, there was the danger of doing too much. Instead of getting fancy, Altidore drilled the ball toward the goal, putting pressure on the keeper, who had other distractions: Clint Dempsey, an intense kid from East Texas, who grew up playing with Mexican friends and had gone overseas to eventually become the all-time leading American scorer in England. He had had a goal taken away earlier by an offside call that looked spurious on the replay; now the Yanks were running out of seconds.</p> <p>"When the ball got played out to Jozy, I tried to make a run," Dempsey would later recall. Altidore drilled the ball into the scrum in front of the goal and Dempsey got his foot on it, but as he tumbled forward he saw the keeper deflecting the ball and he thought, "Oh, no, this is not my day." The momentum carried Dempsey into the goalmouth, like a human cannonball, making contact with the Algerian keeper before tumbling into the back of the net.</p> <p>Any Algerian player might have blasted the ball out of danger&#x2014;as Kristine Lilly and Brandi Chastain had done so acrobatically in the Women&#x2019;s World Cup final of 1999&#x2014;and back in the States those viewers not yet enchanted with soccer might have said, "But nothing happened!"</p> <p>In this case, something did happen. That&#x2019;s why we hold our breath and watch. After passing the ball to Altidore, Donovan had kept running with his beautiful 880-yard gait. He put his foot on the ball from seven yards out and flicked it into the net. Then he dashed to the corner of the field and slid on his stomach like a very happy baby otter, with American players landing on top of him, followed by reserves and staff members and goodness knows who else, a whole nation, in a sense. Redemption in the ninety-first minute.</p> <p>"I was one of the last people to make it to the dog pile," Dempsey recalled.</p> <p>That goal, by young American players of vastly diverse backgrounds, immediately became the greatest single play the United States has ever made in the World Cup&#x2014;considering the lateness of the hour, the distance traveled, the stakes involved, and the higher profile of the American program by 2010, its sixth straight World Cup appearance.</p> <p>When I watched the video of the Donovan goal recently, I felt a surge of respect, all over again, for the sheer degree of difficulty. If Howard had distributed the ball in another direction, if Donovan had gotten giddy on his dash upfield, if Altidore had bungled his possession, if Dempsey had overdone his slide near the keeper and prompted a foul call, if Donovan had blasted the ball into the upper deck&#x2014;all potential failures, an intrinsic part of this sport.</p> <p>Instead, the American players killed off the last three minutes and celebrated on the field, still alive, at the center of their sport, at the center of the world.</p> <p><br>Copyright � 2014 by George Vecsey</p></p><h2>Love and Capital: Karl and Jenny Marx and the Birth of a Revolution</h2><p>Brilliantly researched and wonderfully written, LOVE AND CAPITAL reveals the rarely glimpsed and heartbreakingly human side of the man whose works would redefine the world after his death.

In this meticulously researched and vividly written life, Michael J. Neufeld gives us a man of profound moral complexities, glorified as a visionary and vilified as a war criminal, a man whose brilliance and charisma were coupled with an enormous and, some would say, blinding ambition.<br><br>As one of the leading developers of rocket technology for the German army, von Braun yielded to pressure to join the Nazi Party in 1937 and reluctantly became an SS officer in 1940. During the war, he supervised work on the V-2s, which were assembled by starving slave laborers in a secret underground plant and then fired against London and Antwerp. Thousands of prisoners died&#x2014;a fact he well knew and kept silent about for as long as possible.<br><br>When the Allies overran Germany, von Braun and his team surrendered to the Americans. The U.S. Army immediately recognized his skills and brought him and his colleagues to America to work on the development of guided missiles, in a covert operation that became known as Project Paperclip. He helped launch the first American satellite in 1958 and headed NASA&#x2019;s launch-vehicle development for the Apollo Moon landing.<br><br>Handsome and likable, von Braun dedicated himself to selling the American public on interplanetary travel and became a household name in the 1950s, appearing on Disney TV shows and writing for popular magazines. But he never fully escaped his past, and in later years he faced increasing questions as his wartime actions slowly came to light.<br><br>Based on new sources, <i>Von Braun</i> is a brilliantly nuanced portrait of a man caught between morality and progress, between his dreams of the heavens and the earthbound realities of his life.</p><p>Michael J.

An unusually abstract statement, it prefigured a lifetime of fascination with science and technology.[2]<br><br>Equally surprising, it came from the mouth of a true son of the Junkers&#x2014;the noble caste that had once dominated the Prussian civil service, officer corps, and landowning elite. Engineering and science were not careers that Junker sons often chose, even in the 1920s. It seemed to reflect some inner compulsion of Wernher&#x2019;s, but it also reflected the tenor of the times&#x2014;a time of dramatic technological and political change. He had been born in 1912, in a traditional prewar world; his massively built, mustachioed father, Magnus Freiherr von Braun, had been a rapidly ascending civil servant in the empire of Kaiser Wilhelm II, while his intellectually gifted mother was the orphaned daughter of an estate owner. Less than ten years later his father would be forced out of the civil service in the political turmoil of the new Weimar Republic. The family moved to the modern world city of Berlin. Yet as much of a maverick and a Berliner as Wernher von Braun would turn out to be, his Prussian Junker upbringing influenced his values, his abilities, and his choices&#x2014;more so, in fact, than his father would later be willing to credit.<br><br>Of his parents&#x2019; two families, the von Brauns and the von Quistorps, the former was of much older aristocratic stock. Magnus von Braun, who inherited from his father the hobby of genealogical research, eventually traced the male line back to 1285, although in all probability an ancestor had battled the Mongols at Liegnitz in 1241. The von Brauns arose from the soil of Silesia, a verdant and rolling province on both sides of the Oder River, east of the Czech heartland of Bohemia and Moravia. In 1573 the Holy Roman emperor elevated two of them to the rank of <i>Reichsfreiherr</i> (imperial baron) for their military accomplishments.[3]<br>Magnus von Braun came, however, from an even more distant outpost of Germandom, East Prussia&#x2014;a province that would disappear from the map in 1945, when Stalin divided it between the Soviet Union and Poland. In 1738 one descendant of the family, Gotthard Freiherr von Braun, entered Prussian service as a lieutenant in the garrison of the province&#x2019;s capital city of K�nigsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia). There he married the daughter of a wealthy local burgher. His fifth child, Sigismund, also a Prussian officer, purchased the estate of Neucken, about thirty miles southwest of the city, in 1803 and erected a new house&#x2014;Magnus von Braun&#x2019;s ancestral home. One of the family&#x2019;s close acquaintances in K�nigsberg had been the philosopher Immanuel Kant; the silver sugar spoon he gave to Sigismund as a wedding present was a holy object in the glass cabinet of the mansion, along with a golden snuffbox from Czar Alexander I of Russia. But in February 1807, not long after the house was finished, Napoleon fought the bloody and inconclusive Battle of Preussisch Eylau against the czar&#x2019;s army around Neucken. Napoleon&#x2019;s troops killed or stole all the farm animals, wrecked the estate buildings, and plundered the house, although valuables like Kant&#x2019;s spoon were successfully carried away or hidden. It took the family years to recuperate economically from the damage&#x2014;but the starvation and death inflicted on the estate&#x2019;s enserfed peasantry were much worse.[4]<br><br>On the seventy-first anniversary of the battle, 7 February 1878, a boy, Magnus Alexander Maximilian, was born at Neucken. His father was Lieutenant Colonel Maximilian Freiherr von Braun, who had inherited the estate in part because no fewer than three of his brothers, as Prussian officers, were killed in the 1866 war against Austria- Hungary. Military values and a fervent loyalty to the Hohenzollern kings of Prussia&#x2014;who, after 1871, became emperors of the new, Prussian-dominated Germany&#x2014;were the heart of the values taught on the estate. Magnus was the youngest of five; his brothers Friedrich (Fritz) and Siegfried both became army officers. While Fritz had to terminate his career to take over Neucken shortly before World War I because of the failing health of their father, Siegfried served all through the war, ending as colonel of the Third Guards Regiment. He was forced into other employment only because of the military&#x2019;s drastic downsizing as a result of the Versailles Treaty.[5]<br><br>Acceptable career choices for sons of the Prussian nobility were limited. Every able-bodied male was expected to at least serve a stint in the army before returning to estate agriculture, if there was a prospect of an inheritance&#x2014;which in the nineteenth century was usually limited by primogeniture to the eldest son. Of course, a young man also had the possibility of marrying into an estate or, less often, accumulating enough wealth to buy one. As Prussia&#x2019;s bureaucracy expanded from the eighteenth century on, however, the higher civil service and diplomatic corps opened up as employment possibilities for younger sons. Unlike the British aristocracy, all children of the Prussian aristocracy, male and female, inherited the father&#x2019;s title, with the result that there were a lot of barons, countesses, and the like who usually lived well as a result of the privileges afforded them but had no landed property.<br><br>Daughters in this very patriarchal society inevitably faced even more limited choices. Outside of marriage, about the only prospects they had were to remain with the family as a maiden aunt and sister, or to become a nurse or administrator in a church-based hospital or charity institution. As the Junkers (outside of parts of Silesia) were aggressively Lutheran, the option of taking holy orders was unavailable. Magnus von Braun&#x2019;s oldest sibling, Magdalene (born 1865), remained at Neucken her whole life, whereas Adele eventually became the head of a children&#x2019;s sanatorium on the Baltic coast of East Prussia. Neither ever married.[6]<br><br>Old age often puts a nostalgic glow on one&#x2019;s memories of childhood. Magnus von Braun&#x2019;s memoirs, completed in American exile in the late 1940s and early 1950s, are no exception in that regard. He described Neucken as a patriarchal utopia: &#x201c;the whole estate thought of itself as a large family. . . . Neighborly love . . . was natural and inevitable and at the same time Christian in nature. Patriarchal life on the land bound the people together into a tight community of fate.&#x201d; The housing of Neucken&#x2019;s laborers was, he conceded, &#x201c;still primitive in my earliest youth,&#x201d; but nonetheless it was better than the conditions he later witnessed in eastern Europe&#x2014;not to mention those of blacks and Mexicans in Texas and Alabama. (Prussia had abolished serfdom in the early decades of the century, not necessarily to the benefit of the peasants, who often lost their land.) Raised in a stable, hierarchical, rural society in which dissent was rare, Magnus von Braun never saw any need to question a state of affairs in which the Junkers ran local government as their private preserve and most villages were wholly owned appendages of the estates. Indeed, his memoir forthrightly states his reactionary, monarchist, elitist politics&#x2014;there had always been, and would always be, rulers and ruled; equality was unnatural. In the 1960s he told one of his grandsons, &#x201c;This democracy thing is just a passing fad.&#x201d;[7]<br><br>Educated by a tutor at Neucken until the age of ten, he was then sent to K�nigsberg to receive the traditional elite education of the humanistic Gymnasium, with a heavy emphasis on languages&#x2014;in the upper grades, a lot of Latin and Greek. He apparently showed some talent; after graduating on Easter 1896, he made his way to the old, venerable University of G�ttingen in north-central Germany to study law, the mandatory path into the civil service. With his baronial title and with a healthy stipend from his father, Magnus was able to join an elite dueling fraternity, the Corps Saxonia, &#x201c;which was made up almost exclusively of landed nobles.&#x201d; In the old fraternity tradition, he did not study very hard but rather demonstrated his manliness by drinking and dueling. Graduating in spring 1899, he took his civil service entry exams in K�nigsberg and then did his one-year military service as an officer in the old Prussian royal city of Potsdam, outside Berlin. Again, his connections were the best: he entered the Hohenzollerns&#x2019; elite infantry regiment, the First Foot Guards. Kaiser Wilhelm II&#x2019;s sons served in this regiment, and Magnus&#x2019;s eldest brother, Fritz, was a captain in the Guards&#x2019; Rifle Battalion, which was responsible for the army&#x2019;s first experiments with machine guns. Apparently the young Magnus made such a good impression that, when he finished his service in the fall of 1900, the officers of the regiment made him a reserve lieutenant. The rank and uniform, like the elite fraternity membership, were of great value in Imperial German society.[8]<br><br>Returning to the civil service track, he then served the long, unpaid apprenticeship that led to the second exam and a permanent and paying position&#x2014;a system designed to allow only the propertied access to the higher ranks. After serving in various places in eastern and western Prussia, he passed the assessor&#x2019;s exam in 1905, although not with flying colors. But he showed initiative, a talent for dealing with peopl...</p><h2>Jacob&#39;s Faith (Wolf Breeds, Book 2)</h2><p>Book 2 in the Wold Breeds series They are a new breed, a new race.

In this collection of tales by some of today's best writers, including Margaret Atwood, Toni Cade Bambara, Charles Baxter, Spalding Gray, Susan Minot, and Alice Munro, each story is told by a child character or by the adult who was that child, skillfully preserving the child's voice and role as both an actor and a witness in the drama. </p><p>Chosen by the acclaimed writer Lorrie Moore for their insight and literary brilliance, these stories range across age, gender, class, ethnicity, and geography. They will resonate with readers as they convey not only individual stories of heartache and joy but also universal themes of growing up and coming to see, if not understand, the world in a new and different way.</p></p><p>Lorrie Moore is the author of Birds of America, which was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award and a New York Times bestseller. She teaches at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.These marvelous, fiercely articulate stories liberate the buried child lurking in every adult. Each of the 20 tales is narrated by a youngster or by a grown-up looking back with rueful hindsight. Emotional complexity is the keynote. In Margaret Atwood's "Betty," a girl identifies with a "nice" woman neighbor but later rejects her as a role model when the facade of her perfect marriage crumbles. In Spalding Gray's funny, freewheeling "Sex and Death to the Age 14,"title ok an irrepressible boy growing up in a Christian Science household explores his budding sexuality. The rebellious, pot-smoking heroine of Sheila Schwartz's "Out-of-the-Body Travel"ok must come to terms with her father's desertion and her embittered mother's mental collapse. Amy Tan, Susan Minot, Jamaica Kincaid, Peter Meinke, Leonard Michaels, Harold Brodkey and Alice Munro, among others, explore such issues as divorce, absentee fathers, the immigrant experience, insomnia and a boy's awakening to his homosexuality. These unforgettable, immediate stories reveal how children continually revise their road map of the fearsome, beckoning adult world. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Crime through Time</h2><p>Today&#39;s best American and British mystery authors are featured in this outstanding collection of original historical mysteries.

Her acclaimed histories also include <em>The Incredible Journey of Lewis &amp; Clark, The Great American Gold Rush,</em> and <em>The Remarkable Voyages of Captain Cook,</em> all ALA Notable Books. She is the winner of the <em>Washington Post/</em>Children's Book Guild Award for her overall contribution to nonfiction.</p><p>Rhoda Blumberg says that while doing research for <em>Commodore Perry,</em> "I read about the ordeals and strange adventures of Manjiro, then spent years replaying his life story in my mind until I felt impelled to write about him."</p><p>The author and her husband, Gerald, live in Yorktown Heights, New York.</p>Grade 5 Up The Lewis and Clark expedition, that staple of American history courses, is given a fresh account here. Blumberg explores a confrontation between two cultures, in a manner which is sympathetic to and revealing of the feelings of both peoples. She describes the experience of entering those lands west of the Mississippi, uncharted territory when President Jefferson proposed the expedition in 1803. The 16 chapters which follow the journey are arranged chronologically, concluding with the return of the explorers in 1806. The text is clear and often entertaining, with concrete details to bring historical events to life. Blumberg is refreshingly frank about the humanness of the expedition's members and the relationships that they had with some of the native Americans. The concluding chapter is a rather hasty summing up, but final sections, which include detailed chapter notes and an ``Aftermath'' about the later lives of prominent members of the expedition make up for this. Much care has been taken throughout the book to use and refer to primary sources, both in text and illustrations, which are generally well reproduced. Blumberg is not a great prose stylisther text is often flat, and her people don't come to life. Where she shines is in the imaginative use of extensive research to tell, compellingly and entertainingly, stories from history. She respects her subject and her audience: an approach which makes this an outstanding choice to introduce young readers to this seminal American event.

Intriguingly, the colonel, who projected an image as American as apple pie, was foreign - born (in 1909): a Dutchman named Andreas van Kuijk, he served in the U.S. peacetime army but never became a citizen. He entered the U.S. illegally and as a young man worked in carnivals, where he learned to be a con man par excellence, according to the authors. It was his talent as an operator that led him to become the personal manager of Eddy Arnold, then Hank Snow and finally Elvis. While the authors do not attempt a psychobiography, they argue forcefully that Parker's carnival background made him a conniving money-grubber who eventually destroyed Presley's career. The singer himself does not emerge here as a hero, but he does seem more to be pitied than censured. Vellenga is a Dutch journalist; Farren, an American, is a freelance writer. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.This book focuses on Presley's manager, Colonel Tom Parker, suggesting that his greed and ruthlessness led to the ruin of Presley's career and perhaps caused his death. In 1955 Parker signed the first of many, increasingly manipulative contracts with Presleycontracts that eventually gave Parker a greater share of the Presley empire than the King himself. Presley was treated like a money-making machine, kept isolated from friends, and well supplied with drugs. Although based on interviews, the book offers little actual documentation to back up its thesis. But the narrative is well written and convincing. About a third of the book is an appendix of concert and recording dates and a discography. A real eye-opener for Presley fans. Tim LaBorie, Drexel Univ.
